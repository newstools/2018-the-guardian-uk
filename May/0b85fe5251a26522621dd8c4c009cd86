This salad is my go-to dish whenever I need a boost of energy and green goodness. It’s impossible not to feel in better spirits after eating so many good-for-you ingredients. With the nutritional powerhouse of spinach as its base, this is a simple, healthy recipe that is easily adaptable to any ingredients you may have to hand. For those with nut allergies, you can replace the almonds with a lovely handful of toasted sesame seeds or, my personal favourite, toasted sunflower seeds. For the dressing: 500ml water1 tsp salt2 cloves garlic1 lemon, juiced25g dill1g spirulina powder250g tahini For the salad: 90g green asparagus, cut into 1 inch-chunks180g purple sprouting broccoli, destalked180g green beans (chopped at an angle)60g mangetout beans (ends chopped off)180g fennel or white cabbage, thinly sliced30g young spinach15g sorrel2 tbsp mint leaves2 tbsp pomegranate seeds30g almonds, toasted1/2 tsp sea saltExtra virgin olive oil Add all dressing ingredients except the tahini into a blender and blend at high speed until smooth. Then add in the tahini and blend at low speed until well mixed. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the asparagus for 2-4 minutes, depending on thickness. With a slotted spoon, transfer the spears to a bowl of ice-cold water. Add the green beans to the same boiling water, blanch for 3 minutes and transfer to the same bowl as the asparagus. Then, blanch the sprouting broccoli in the same water for two minutes, take out and place in the cold water bowl for just a minute. Remove all greens from the bowl, then dry them well. Transfer all the greens to a large bowl and add all the remaining salad ingredients. Mix well and add half a teaspoon of sea salt and a dash of extra virgin olive oil. Add the tahini dressing, stir gently, taste and add more salt if you like. •Mercedes Sieff is the co-owner of Yeotown Kitchen in Marylebone, London, and Yeotown retreat in Devon
