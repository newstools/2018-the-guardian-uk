Gwyneth Paltrow has released more details of her alleged experiences with Harvey Weinstein. Speaking on Wednesday on Howard Stern’s Sirius XM radio show, Paltrow again accused Weinstein of sexually harassing her in the 1990s. “We had one incident in a hotel room where he tried to make a pass at me,” she said, saying that he requested she give him a massage. “It was weird,” she said. “I was alone in a room with him. It was out of the blue. I was blind-sided. I was shocked.” Paltrow, who was hired aged 22 by Weinstein to play the lead in Emma, told her then boyfriend, Brad Pitt, about the incident. “I told him right away and I was very shaken by the whole thing,” said Paltrow. “We were at the opening of Hamlet on Broadway. Harvey was there and Brad Pitt – it was like the equivalent of throwing him against the wall, energetically.” “He said, ‘If you ever make her feel uncomfortable again, I’ll kill you.’ Or something like that. It was so fantastic. He leveraged his fame and power to protect me at a time when I didn’t have fame or power yet.” Paltrow first accused Weinstein of sexual harassment in the New York Times, where she said that after the alleged incident, he rang her and told her not to speak to anyone else about it. “I thought he was going to fire me,” she said. “He screamed at me for a long time. It was brutal.” More than 60 women have so far accused the former movie mogul of various forms of sexual assault and misconduct. Weinstein, 66, has consistently denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.
