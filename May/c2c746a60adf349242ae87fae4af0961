Siya Kolisi will become South Africa’s first black captain after being handed the role for the Test series against England next month. The 26-year-old flanker was the vice-captain to Eben Etzebeth last year and temporarily took over when the second-row was off the field but has been awarded the role on a full-time basis for the three-Test series. Chiliboy Ralepelle was the captain of a South Africa team against a World XV in 2006 but, with Etzebeth and Warren Whiteley injured, Kolisi will be the first black player to captain the Springboks in a Test in their 127-year history. The appointment comes two days after Rassie Erasmus named a squad which includes five overseas-based players – Sale’s Faf de Klerk, Willie le Roux of Wasps as well as Duane Vermeulen, Bismarck du Plessis and Francois Steyn. Erasmus has wasted little time in making changes since taking over from Allister Coetzee but the former Munster director of rugby denied Kolisi, who captains the Stormers, has been appointed out of tokenism. South Africa’s stated aim is for 50% of the World Cup squad next year to be black players as part of transformation goals but Erasmus said: “I know Siya is a good leader and I am excited about what he can offer us. I have always understood the transformation issues and that they are part of the way we are heading and I have bought into that. “We are trying to fix all the wrong things that were done in the past. The recent things that happened did not have a bearing on this decision because my contract was signed long before. The players we have in this squad deserve to be here and I am not trying to fabricate things.” Kolisi will not be considered for selection against Wales in Washington DC on Saturday so Pieter-Steph du Toit has been named as the captain for that match.
