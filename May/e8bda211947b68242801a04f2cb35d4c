I broke up with my ex-girlfriend six months ago and while I’m still sad about it and sometimes miss her, it’s been a life-shattering event for her. She says she still loves me and cries thinking about me most days; we’ve also been through periods of not talking and that doesn’t seem to help either. I want to move on with my life, but whenever I meet other women I feel despondent, almost like I have no interest in sex, yet when I’m alone I often feel lonely and horny. People tell me to let her go, but I feel responsible for her pain and it’s bringing me down. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
