A Paris gallery has given nearly 200 people the rare chance of a clothes-free visit, the latest opportunity for the city’s flourishing nudist scene. Palais de Tokyo, a contemporary art museum in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, offered a guided tour before opening to the general public on Saturday. Following the visit, which the museum described as the first of its kind in France, the Paris Naturists’ Association said: “What a day to remember. A new chapter in naturism is opening.” The participants, who snapped up the tickets in two days after the event was announced in March, were able to strip down for the show Discordia, Daughter of the Night. They were also treated to a private cocktail party on the museum’s roof. “An incredible moment, what a success. Mindsets are changing and naturism is becoming commonplace,” the association said. Paris has become increasingly attentive to fans of baring their all. The French capital set aside a designated patch for nudists in Bois de Vincennes park in the east of the city last year. They can also enjoy a meal at their own restaurant, O’Naturel.
