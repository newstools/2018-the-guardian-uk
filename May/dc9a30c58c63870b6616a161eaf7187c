Sam Shankland is the new US champion after a bravura performance where the Californian 26-year-old outscored America’s elite trio of Fabiano Caruana, Wesley So and Hikaru Nakamura, who between them had won the previous three titles. Shankland totalled an impressive 8.5/11, was awarded the $50,000 first prize, and advanced his world rating to 2700, only the seventh American to reach the super-grandmaster level. Caruana, who challenges Magnus Carlsen for the world crown in November, was the pre-tournament favourite and fought hard all the way but was half a point short at the end. His early unnecessary defeat against Zviad Izoria, where he refused a draw then overpressed in the endgame, proved costly, and Caruana also had narrow escapes against Shankland and Nakamura. Meanwhile, thousands of miles away in Shamkir, Azerbaijan, Carlsen stayed in second gear as he won the elite event unbeaten with 6/9, three wins and six draws. The world champion was mostly content to halve with Black and press with White, though he did make an exception in a convincing game against Anish Giri, the Netherlands No 1. For long Carlsen had a minus score against the Dutchman and there is needle between them. Reverting to Shankland, the intriguing question is how he was able to make such a quantum jump in his results in his mid-20s, an age at which players normally start to plateau. One significant factor which the new US champion mentioned has been his sessions with IM Jacob Aagaard, whose advanced instruction book, Thinking Inside the Box, has a foreword by Shankland and includes extended advice on how to look for and select candidate moves when you are analysing. A summary of its contents and an excerpt can be found online. Shankland’s own book, Small Steps to Giant Improvement, was published last month and shows the importance of pawn play in strategic chess. Writing your first major book can be a stimulus to a results breakthrough for a strong master. Other notable instances being Reuben Fine who wrote his seminal work Basic Chess Endings just a few months before he scored his greatest triumph, shared first at Avro 1038, and Bobby Fischer, whose classic My 60 Memorable Games was published not long before he began his surge to the world title in 1970-72. There was another significant milestone for China’s steady and persistent advance as a major chess power. Ding Liren finished second in Shamkir, half a point behind Carlsen, jumped to No 6 in the world, the highest ever by a player from his country, and moved to within 10 points of the elite 2800 level. Shankland’s 15-year-old opponent in the final round tried to surprise him with a recent Caro-Kann novelty 7…e5!? only to be met immediately by the still more recent 8 h3! when the critical line, prepared by Shankland, runs 8…Na5 7 Qc2 exf4 10 hxg4 Nxg4 11 Kf1 h5. Liang’s 8…exf4? followed by 11…g6?! (g5!) was weaker and White soon had a clear edge, with the g5 pawn restricting Black’s activity. When Shankland’s 18 Nb3! switched to an attack against the light squares around the black king, Liang had no answer and 32 Bxc6+! led to a winning endgame. At the end Black resigned in the face of the double threat 44 Nxd5, winning another pawn, and 44 Re3-g3, trapping the knight.
