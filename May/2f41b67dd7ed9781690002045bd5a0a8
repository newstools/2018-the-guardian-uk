The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘different.’ Share your photos of what different means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box. The closing date is Wednesday 16 May at 10am. We’ll publish our favourites in The New Review on Sunday 20 May. You can share your ‘different’ pictures by clicking on the ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the Guardian app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’ – and if you add it to the homepage – you can keep up with all our assignments.
