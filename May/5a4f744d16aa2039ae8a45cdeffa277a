I’m the youngest of four sisters – and Cynthia is one up from me. She is four years older than I am. We grew up in a blue-collar family a few miles into the countryside outside Chicago. The thing that really stands out about Cynthia is that she has always dared to be different. She was always questioning the status quo; challenging the way things were around us. And seeing her do that gave me the courage to question things, and also to explore my own world. She’s always had that ability to look at life from a totally different and unexpected perspective, to turn events on their head and reveal a different side to them – and her example encouraged me to do that in my life, too. Now we’re older we’re still exploring: right now we’re travelling a lot together, so we’re visiting new countries. It’s great being older because you have so much more time to take trips and have adventures, like we are now. And we also have more time for other people. Cynthia and I have always been close, and in our 60s we’re as close as ever. Is there someone you’d like to say thank you to? Write to us at magazine@observer.co.uk
