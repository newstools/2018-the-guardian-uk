Liverpool fans whose flights to watch their side in the Champions League final in Ukraine were cancelled face bitter disappointment after the city’s mayor said he had been unable to resolve the “utter shambles” in time. More than 700 supporters face missing the game after two operators cancelled a total of three flights to Kiev because landing slots could not be allocated for them. One of them, Worldchoice Sports, initially cancelled three – though one was reinstated and left for Kiev on Friday morning. A second company, Air Partner, cancelled one flight on the eve of the match. Liverpool FC expect about 730 fans to be affected. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, had said he was working with Kiev’s mayor, the former boxer Vitali Klitschko, and airlines to find a solution for all those who face missing out. But by Friday afternoon he said he was “gutted” that he was unable to find a solution. Anderson wrote on Twitter: “Hugely disappointed that our efforts to sort #LFC fan flights has not worked @Vitaliy-Klychko & airport directors did all possible with landing slots and planes but not able to get over the line. Frustrated by utter shambles faced by loyal fans. The company has said it can’t resolve it, we have to respect that. Gutted we got so close.” Liverpool have offered full refunds on tickets for the final to the fans whose flights were cancelled, as ticket holders called the travel problems an “absolute joke”. A statement on the club website said: “The decision to offer refunds has been made in response to the cancellation of two flights chartered by Widnes-based travel company Worldchoice Sports, leaving about 650 supporters without a flight to Kiev for the Champions League final.” A later statement added: “Liverpool FC has been made aware of the cancellation of a further charter flight to Kiev operated by Air Partner Ltd and booked through travel agents Myriad Travel and Crown Travel. “As with those affected by the cancelled or rearranged World Choice Sport flights, supporters due to travel to Kiev from Liverpool John Lennon Airport on flight number SVB116 will also be entitled to apply for a refund of their match ticket for the Champions League final.” Raj Soni, the manager of Worldchoice Sports, blamed poor organisation in Kiev for the problem. In a statement on its website, the company said: “We have exhausted all avenues to try to get landing slots. We have had them from Liverpool airport and Manchester airport, and we have applied for slots in the correct manner and timeframe with the authorities. To reiterate – this problem IS with Kiev.” Liverpool are expecting more than 20,000 supporters to travel to the Ukrainian capital for the match at Olimpiyskiy stadium. On social media, Liverpool fans expressed their disappointment and anger at the lack of information they had received. Just Spoke to @worldchoicespo customer service - 100% blaming Kiev airport. Allocated to many slots to private jets to make more money @Vitaliy_Klychko They also say @mayor_anderson is lying about the additional slots available and is spinning the PR line.0% chance of going😥 So we’ve got a day to get a refund!!!! “Favourable outcome” ❌This whole situation is an absolute joke. Not @LFC fault but is that are left here just get a refund and all swept under the carpet eh? Not good enough on any level by any stakeholders apart from those let down https://t.co/Ex7BAxYjO8 Jason McGimpsey, 43, a financial adviser, said he had been looking forward to the trip of a lifetime, but was told on Thursday that his flight was cancelled. “Worldchoice Sports had been stalling on giving us e-tickets and exact departure times, and it’s become clear why that was the case. Now, finally they’ve said ‘we’ve cancelled it’,” he said. “I’ve been offered a refund, but it doesn’t go anywhere near compensating me for what I’ve lost. For various personal reasons, I was unable to go to the finals in Istanbul or Athens. I go to practically all Liverpool games and I haven’t missed a home game in nearly four years.”
