Helena Bonham Carter has said she is terrified to be taking over from Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret in the third series of the drama The Crown. Bonham Carter, who was previously rumoured for Netflix’s show, was officially announced for the role alongside Jason Watkins, who will play Harold Wilson. They join previously announced cast members Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II and Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip, who are taking over from Claire Foy and Matt Smith. Kirby was nominated for a Bafta for her portrayal of Margaret. Bonham Carter said: “I’m not sure which I’m more terrified about – doing justice to the real Princess Margaret or following in the shoes of Vanessa Kirby’s Princess Margaret. “The only thing I can guarantee is that I’ll be shorter [than Vanessa].” Watkins said: “I am delighted to become part of this exceptional show. And so thrilled to be working once again with Peter Morgan. Harold Wilson is a significant and fascinating character in our history. So looking forward to bringing him to life, through a decade that transformed us culturally and politically. “And I am excited to be working so closely with Olivia; and the whole team.” Bonham Carter, 51, is known for her many film roles, including her Bafta-winning peformance in The King’s Speech, as well as The Wings of the Dove, Hamlet and the Harry Potter films. Watkins, 51, won a Bafta for his role in mini-series The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies, and has also starred in TV shows Trollied, Being Human and Dirk Gently. Created by Morgan, The Crown will refresh its cast as time goes on to reflect the ageing of the characters. The first series covered the period 1947 to 1955; the second 1956 to 1963. The Crown will return for series three in 2019.
