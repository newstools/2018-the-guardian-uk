Peel 1 large onion, or 2 medium-sized ones, and slice thinly into rings. Warm 3 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan, then fry the onions over a low heat for about 20-25 minutes. Stir the onions regularly, until they are soft, translucent and pale gold in colour. Bring a medium-sized pan of water to the boil. While the onions are cooking, pod 600g of broad beans, then cook them in the boiling water for about 7 minutes, depending on their size. Check them for tenderness, then drain. If you wish, pop the beans from their papery skins. This won’t be necessary with the smallest of the beans. Warm a grill or griddle pan. Lightly oil and season 6 lamb cutlets (as well as both salt and black pepper, I like to include some fresh thyme here, and a little crushed garlic) and cook them until their fat is golden. The inside should be pink and juicy. Remove the onions from the heat and strain off any excess olive oil. Fold 100ml of soured cream and most of the broad beans through the onions, and season with black pepper and a little chopped parsley. Divide the onions and soured cream between 2 warm plates, settle the cutlets next to them and serve with the remaining beans, and a little parsley. The onions cannot be hurried. Keep the heat low and stir them often. They should not brown, but colour lightly. They are done only when they are soft enough to crush between thumb and finger. Add the soured cream just before serving and don’t allow it to get too hot, otherwise it will “split”. The soured cream is a wonderful contrast to the sweet onions, but you could use crème fraîche or yogurt if you prefer. Young spring cabbage could be used instead of the broad beans. Shred it finely, cook briefly in boiling water then drain before folding into the onions. Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
