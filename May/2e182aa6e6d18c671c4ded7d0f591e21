The man who is set to be named as the new Arsenal manager has already joined the club – according to Unai Emery’s official website. On Tuesday evening www.unai-emery.com suddenly showed an image of the former Paris Saint-Germain coach on a red background next to the Arsenal badge with a message declaring: “proud to be part of the Arsenal family”. The 46-year-old is yet to be confirmed as the successor to Arsène Wenger but that looks a mere formality now. Emery left PSG at the end of this campaign after a two-year stint where he won one Ligue 1 title and four domestic cups, having led Sevilla to three successive Europa League trophies prior to that. Mikel Arteta, Luis Enrique and Juventus’ Massimiliano Allegri were among those strongly linked to the role and Emery had been seen as only an outside bet with bookmakers since Wenger’s departure was first confirmed last month.
