My favourite Famous Five book is Five Run Away Together. The premise was wish-fulfilment for most children: the opportunity to self-govern on an island with no grownups. I loved the descriptions of Kirrin Island’s natural caves and the heather beds they made for themselves. But the thing I loved most was the way Enid Blyton wrote about food. With hindsight, they are mostly revolting pairings: at one point the children consume a breakfast of “tongue, tinned peaches, bread and butter, golden syrup and ginger beer”. Blyton describes it as a “fine” meal. Objectively, we know this is a lie. And yet, when I closed my eyes, I could taste those peaches. Reading about food holds a unique pleasure. There’s an invisible contract between writer and reader: the former is trying to paint a picture using known colours and textures, while leaving room for the reader’s own interpretations. In the most sensual food book I’ve read, Like Water For Chocolate, Laura Esquivel names her chapters after a month and includes a recipe. In March, her heroine Tita makes quail in rose petal sauce. When I read it, I hadn’t even imagined roses were edible; afterwards, they were all I wanted to eat. Recently, I had a meal so astonishingly good, I dreamed about it that night: smoky mushroom toast, bitter and cleansing radicchio with olives and parmesan, roast cauliflower with lemon aïoli, grilled sea bass, hanger steak with smoked tomato butter and beets, and perhaps the crispiest duck confit in the world. The chef and his restaurateur wife, old friends of a new friend, clinked glasses with us as we tucked into a pot de crème. Outside, rain fell softly. It felt like a scene in a book I needed to write.
