A search has been launched for a 13-year-old schoolgirl who left the UK on a Eurostar train. Serena Alexander-Benson was last seen by her father leaving her home in Wimbledon, south-west London, at 7.50am on Friday. She left wearing her mostly green uniform and had told him she was going to school, the Metropolitan police said. But the girl, who has not been missing before, did not arrive at school and has not been seen since. Police are concerned for her welfare. Wandsworth CID officers are investigating. Officers say they believe the teenager left the UK from Folkestone, Kent, on Friday morning via a Eurostar train, and it is thought that she travelled “probably in the company of an older person”. She lives with her father. Her mother lives in Poland. Anyone who saw the student travelling through Folkestone, or with information on her whereabouts, is urged to call Wandsworth CID on 0203 276 2588.
