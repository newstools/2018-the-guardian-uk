Manchester United are considering marking their final Premier League match, at home to Watford on Sunday, with a gesture of support for Sir Alex Ferguson. United confirmed on Wednesday night that Ferguson “no longer needs intensive care” as their former manager recuperates after a brain haemorrhage. Ferguson underwent an operation on Saturday at Salford Royal Hospital and remains there, having collapsed at his home in Wilmslow that morning. The positive bulletin on Ferguson’s condition has increased the likelihood that the club will make a public show of support on Sunday. Also on Wednesday José Mourinho offered encouragement regarding the 76-year-old’s health. “We are very, very positive,” he said. “We are confident.” Mourinho’s team are at West Ham United on Thursday night. Asked how Ferguson’s condition might affect the display, the manager said: “I can only think that if there is any relation it is a positive relation.” Ferguson ended his 26-and-a-half-year tenure at United in May 2013 as British football’s most successful manager, claiming the last of his 13 Premier League titles that season.
