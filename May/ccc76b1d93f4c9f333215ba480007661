Mohamed Salah has said his ambitions for silverware with Liverpool extend beyond this season and that progress to the Champions League final represents the start of a new era under Jürgen Klopp. The Egypt international has been linked frequently with a move to Real Madrid, Liverpool’s opponents in Kiev on 26 May, during a debut campaign at Anfield in which he has scored 43 goals. The 25-year-old’s impact was recognised again on Thursday night when he was named players’ player of the season and player of the season at Liverpool’s awards dinner. Salah collected the prizes at Anfield before taking a private jet to London to collect another one, the Football Writers’ Association player of the year award. Before his departure, Liverpool’s leading scorer was asked directly about leaving the club only a year after his £36.9m arrival from Roma. “I’m very happy here, I’m very happy and everything is fine,” replied Salah, who is expected to be offered an improved contract by Liverpool. “I have got ambitions for the future with Liverpool. As you can see we had a great season and now we are in the Champions League final and everyone is excited. It is just the start. This is my first year here and it is the same for some other players. I didn’t watch all the games last season of the team but this year we have had an unbelievable year.” Liverpool need a point at home to Brighton on Sunday to secure a place in next season’s Champions League irrespective of the outcome against Real. Salah believes he can be part of a sustained period of success at Anfield. “We are very comfortable we will be playing in the Champions League next season,” he said. “On the way to the final we beat top teams like Manchester City and Roma. It is just the beginning. We want to qualify for the Champions League next season and then we want to win the Champions League final. We will play to win against Real Madrid.”
