The parents of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager shot dead while walking home from a convenience store by George Zimmerman, have claimed they are owed at least $150,000 (Â£110,000) by the Weinstein Company. According to documents filed by Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin in a Delaware bankruptcy court, the company formerly run by the disgraced Hollywood mogul entered into a deal to purchase the rights to a possible movie and TV series based on their book, Rest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin. Fulton and Martin say the figure is what they are owed as executive producers of a TV series that has been filmed but not yet broadcast. The film rights were also optioned by the Weinsteins but have not been exercised. Zimmerman was acquitted of charges in connection with the 2012 killing, which is credited as being one of the spurs for the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement. Earlier this month, the sale was approved of the assets of the Weinstein Company, which has filed for bankruptcy, to the Dallas private equity firm Lantern Capital. Numerous claims of money owed by the Weinstein Company have been made, from Quentin Tarantino, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro and others.
