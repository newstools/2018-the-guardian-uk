Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to prepare options for reducing the number of US troops in South Korea, the New York Times has reported, citing several people briefed on the matter. Reduced US troop levels were not intended to be a bargaining chip in Trump’s planned summit in late May or early June with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, about Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. Officials said, however, that a peace treaty between the two Koreas could diminish the need for the 23,500 US soldiers stationed on the peninsula. A full withdrawal of US troops was unlikely, the officials said. But a US National Security Council official told a visiting South Korean official in Washington the report was false, the South Korean presidential office said in a statement. The White House and Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump has said the US should consider reducing the number of troops in South Korea unless it shoulders more of the cost. Former CIA director Mike Pompeo, who is now US secretary of state, met Kim last month and reported the North Korean leader was not demanding the withdrawal of all US forces as a precondition for a summit with Trump. South Korea said on Wednesday the issue of US troops stationed in the South was unrelated to any future peace treaty with North Korea and that American forces should stay even if such an agreement is signed.
