You don’t want fussy desserts on a barbecue day. What you need is something easy and fun: for mum or dad to be forcibly ousted from their role as lord of the barbecue for a while (do it quick, before they martyr themselves over the coals), and for everyone else to entertain themselves around the embers, taking pudding into their own hands. S’mores are perfect for this. Toasting the marshmallows is great fun for little ones, but you’ll want to keep a close eye to make sure the kids don’t end up toasted themselves. Prep 5 minCook 3 minMakes 6 12 malted milk biscuits 75g milk or dark chocolate6 marshmallows6 raspberries Soak wooden skewers in a little water for at least 10 minutes before you get started, so they don’t blacken and burn when they hit the barbecue. Lay out six of the biscuits and put a square of chocolate on each. Push a marshmallow on to each skewer and carefully hold them over the hottest part of the barbecue – you want the marshmallows to toast quickly, otherwise they’ll just melt, droop and slip off the stick into the coals. As soon as each marshmallow is ready, use a fork to pull it off the skewer and on to one of the chocolate-topped biscuits. Push a raspberry down into the middle of the marshmallow, then sandwich with another biscuit. Leave to cool for a minute, during which time the chocolate should melt a little, then enjoy messily.
