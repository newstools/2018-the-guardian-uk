Pep Guardiola admitted it would be nice for Manchester City to reach 100 points after his champions moved to 94 with their goalless draw at home to Huddersfield Town. It was the first time his side had failed to score in the Premier League at home this season but City still have two matches left to reach 100 points and in the process better Chelsea’s record haul of 96. After Vincent Kompany, the captain, had lifted the trophy Guardiola said: “We cannot deny it would be nice to reach 100 but it’s nicer when you win the Premier League title. We spoke about that, these targets help to be focused. We tried [today] and it’s so difficult. It was so warm out there and the players suffered a little bit, especially in the first half. “I’m so satisfied but the game showed me how difficult everything is. [Huddersfield] came here, played defensively perfect – a lot of credit to them. It looks easy when you have to win games – next season it will be tougher. They’ll all want to beat us and we have to be focused. We have to understand how difficult it will be next season.” Of where he will keep his winners’ medal Guardiola said: “Of course it will be in the right place, my daughters and son have them. I think all of us won’t need to see the medal to see what we’ve done. It was something special.” Along with Yaya Touré, Kompany and Sergio Agüero, David Silva has been a member of all three of City’s Premier League-winning teams. “With what happened to my son [born prematurely in the spring], I am very happy, he is getting better, we have won title,” Silva said. “I feel good, even having to travel to Spain and back to England [to check progress], but we got it, we are the champions.” John Stones said: “This is a dream come true; me and Kyle [Walker] were saying that’s why we’ve come here. The manager is always wanting to improve us, individually and as a team. You see all of the staff out there – that’s why we gel well as a team.”
