The revelation that the actor Claire Foy was paid less than her male co-star in the Netflix hit The Crown caused a royal scandal in March, amid allegations of sexism in the entertainment industry. Now Foy will reportedly receive backpay for her performance as the Queen, as the makers of the Netflix drama seek to close the gender pay gap. It is not known how much more Matt Smith was paid for playing Prince Philip in the first two seasons of the hit show but, according to the Daily Mail, Foy would get about £200,000 ($US274,000) in backpay. The Crown, which focuses on the Queen’s early reign, was one of the most expensive television shows ever produced, with the first season costing a reported £94m ($US130m). When details of the pay gap emerged, the producers attributed it to Smith’s six-year stint as the star of Doctor Who, one of Britain’s most popular television shows. They said they would rectify the discrepancy in the future. Foy, 33, won a Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild awards for her portrayal of Britain’s monarch in the 1950s and 1960s. Other actors will take on the roles of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in season three of the show, as the characters age and the story moves into the 1970s. The ongoing pay disparity between men and women was reflected in annual lists published by Forbes magazine. In 2017 Emma Stone topped the best-paid actress list on £19m ($US26m), while Mark Wahlberg was the highest paid man, with £49m ($US68m) in estimated annual earnings. Wahlberg made news this year when it was revealed that he was paid £1m ($US1.5m) for reshoots on movie All the Money in the World while his co-star Michelle Williams got £725 ($1,000). Wahlberg later donated his salary to Time’s Up, the campaign against workplace sexual misconduct.
