Joe Root has admitted his frustration at not being able to find form for Yorkshire during their past two County Championship games, although the England Test captain was at least able to take a glimpse into the future having seen Ollie Pope and Sam Curran shine for Surrey during their innings victory achieved on the morning of day four. Root’s brief return to county colours before the international summer has yielded scores of 0, 35, 14 and 23 in a victory against Essex at Chelmsford and defeat here. He will now turn his attentions to squad selection for the first Test against Pakistan a week on Thursday and meet the new national selector Ed Smith on Tuesday. “When you come back to Yorkshire, you want to perform and give a bit back to the side. It’s been a little bit disappointing,” said Root, who led Yorkshire at the Oval owing to Gary Ballance’s illness. “But that’s cricket, it can be challenging. “I didn’t come into these games to get ready for the Test matches. I made sure I did my preparation beforehand to try to perform well for Yorkshire. It’s just not materialised, unfortunately. That’s just how it can go.” Root and the Yorkshire coach, Andrew Gale, bemoaned missed opportunities in the field during the first day as the primary reason for their defeat, with the 20-year-old Pope nearly run out on the way to a career‑best 158 not out as Surrey recovered from 162 for six to post 414 on a pitch which offered help for the seamers all the way through. This was their second win from four matches. Alongside Pope, their other hero was the 19-year-old left-arm seamer Curran, who claimed six wickets in the first innings and finished with his first 10-wicket match haul – 10 for 101. Root said: “Their two young lads were very impressive. On a wicket that offered a bit, Ollie played really well. He has a good all‑round game and put our bowlers under pressure. Sam bowled nicely. To back it up having enforced the follow-on was impressive.”
