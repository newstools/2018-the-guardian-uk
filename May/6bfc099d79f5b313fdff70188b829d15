A couple attacked by a crocodile got married days later in a Zimbabwean hospital where the bride was recovering after losing an arm. Jamie Fox and Zenele Ndlovu were canoeing on the Zambezi, one of Africa’s longest rivers, when the attack happened on 30 April. Ndlovu lost her right arm and sustained injuries to her left hand. Five days later the couple go married in a hospital chapel. “In one week we went from shock and agony to a truly amazing experience,” Fox said. “We were glad we still had our lives and managed to keep our wedding date, although we had to do with a much smaller venue. The celebrations went ahead at the original venue but Zenele and I had to remain at the hospital.” He said the attack had been terrifying. “I was shouting, trying to save her. She was not complaining of pain when we managed to pull her out of the water, maybe because of the shock. We were hoping the doctors would save her arm but that was not to be.” The couple had been dating for about 18 months. “I proposed in February. We are hoping to settle in the UK, so we are sorting out her visa and then we will think of the honeymoon,” Fox said. Ndlovu was discharged from the hospital on Monday.
