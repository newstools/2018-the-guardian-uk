Put the juice of half a lemon, 6 tbsp of olive oil, 8 mint leaves and a small handful of parsley leaves into a blender, season with a little salt and process to a thick, bright green dressing. Slice a couple of medium-sized tomatoes, lay them in a single layer on a serving plate then moisten them with a spoonful of the dressing. Grind over a little black pepper then cover and set aside for a good 20 minutes. Pod 500g of peas from their pods. You should be left with about 175g of peas. Chop the peas roughly then scoop them into a small bowl. Crumble 100g of feta cheese into tiny pieces and fold through the peas. Place 100g of very thinly sliced bresaola on top of the tomatoes then spoon the peas and cheese on top. Finish with the mint and parsley dressing. This is a last moment assembly, and much depends on the freshness of the tomatoes, raw peas and the sprightly dressing. It is the sort of thing to put together just before you want to eat. Use finely sliced kohlrabi in place of the tomatoes, but give the slices a good hour in the dressing before serving. Swap the bresaola for thin slices of smoked trout, which will work beautifully with the peas, and include a little thinly sliced cucumber, too.
