A 24-year-old British man missing in Colombia has been found dead at the foot of a waterfall. Joe Tilley, from Leicester, was discovered on Saturday near the Fin Del Mundo falls near Mocoa city in the south-west of the country, after going missing the previous week. His father, Ian Hussey, had flown to Colombia in an effort to find him and set up Twitter and Facebook accounts using the handle “Find Joe Tilley”. Tilley’s family announced his death on Sunday and asked for space to grieve. A fundraising campaign has been launched to raise the £4,500 needed to repatriate his body and a further £4,000 for funeral costs. By Sunday afternoon, the campaign had raised more than £7,000. It is understood that Tilley had been volunteering and travelling in South America at the time of his death. In a Facebook post dated 4 May he said about his experience volunteering in Nicaragua: “The work we did was amazing and I do think we helped out the community in the long run. A massive thank you to everyone who donated.” A friend posted on the GoFundMe page: “He had amazing people around him who cared and loved him. He deserves all the love he gets and more.” Another said: “Joe was the most kind-hearted and free-spirited person and will be greatly missed.” A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “Our staff are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Colombia and are in touch with the local authorities.”
