A man in his 20s has been left partially paralysed after being struck by a sword that passed through the visor of his helmet during a medieval re-enactment event in Belgium. The man was warming up for a sword fight in the grounds of ‘t Hooghuys Castle in Berlaar, near Antwerp, when the incident occurred. Joël Dumont, the organiser of the event, told the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad that the injured man knew his opponent in the duel well and there was no suggestion of any blame. He said: “Obviously it is intense, but of course it is not a fight for life or death. The sword fighters are also completely wrapped in a heavy armour for safety. There is only a narrow visor to look through. “The two sword fighters were warming up when a sword through the visor landed in the eyes of the swordsman. His eye was touched, but the sword also penetrated further into the underlying tissue of the head. This caused a brain haemorrhage.” He added: “It was just brutal bad luck. Such a visor is very narrow and yet the sword has been hit by it. If you accidentally go towards the eyes, then the narrow visor will normally stop the swords. But the angle was apparently identical, as a result of which the sword slipped in. You are more likely to win the lotto than this occurring.” The rules of the sword fight encourage participants to touch the body of their foe to score points. The swords are blunt but heavy. The incident occurred at Quondam, an annual two-day spectacle featuring re-enactments of bloody battles, archery contests, jousting tournaments, medieval markets and banquets. Hundreds of members of historical associations attended the event along with thousands of spectators. The victim, part of the recently formed Den Yzeren Beer historical association, is said to have been left paralysed on one side of his body. Doctors are uncertain whether the damage will be permanent.
