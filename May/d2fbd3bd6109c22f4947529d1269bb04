 Roaming packs of feral dogs have killed six children in the past week in northern India, terrifying villagers who have begun keeping their children at home and killing any dogs they encounter. At least two dozen more children have been injured in attacks. The children aged between five and 12 years old have been killed in and around the town of Sitapur, about 50 miles (80km) from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, said Anand Kulkarni, a senior police officer. Many of the attacks occurred when children were out gathering mangoes or when they left their homes to use outhouse toilets, he said. Twelve children have been killed in dog attacks in the area since November, officials said. India has millions of strays that wander the streets in even the most exclusive neighbourhoods. While injuries from dog attacks are fairly common, a string of fatalities in one area is rare. Some villagers believe the attacks began after a nearby illegal slaughterhouse was closed, making the dogs more aggressive after they were left without a major source of food. Education officials said some schools had seen a significant drop in attendance because of the attacks. Parents have been told to accompany their children to and from school. The recent deaths included three children killed by a pack of strays on 1 May, Kulkarni said. Two more children died on 4 May. On Friday, a seven-year-old girl named Gita had gone with two other children to pick mangoes from an orchard when a pack of dogs attacked them, police said. Two children escaped but Gita was surrounded by the dogs. Her screams alerted villagers who ran to help, but she had died by the time they reached her. Harshdeo Pandey, a Sitapur magistrate, said villagers had been told not to allow their children to use outhouses on their own. “We also suggest that children should not be allowed to go out to play for a few days, until all these dogs are caught,” he said.
