Donald Trump appeared to threaten to get involved in an ongoing dispute between the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and Republicans in Congress on Wednesday. In a tweet, Trump said: “A Rigged System – They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal ‘justice?’ At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!” They seemed to refer to Rosenstein, who said in public remarks on Tuesday that “the Department of Justice will not be extorted” after being asked about articles of impeachment reportedly being prepared against him by some congressional Republicans. The threat of impeachment is being used as leverage for Republican to get more information about the federal investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election as well as Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. Earlier in April, the justice department handed over a redacted document about the origins of the Russia investigation to the House intelligence committee after its chair, Devin Nunes, publicly mused about holding law enforcement officials in contempt of Congress or even impeaching them for not cooperating. Rosenstein said on Tuesday that “if we were to just open our doors to allow Congress to come and rummage through the files, that would be a serious infringement on the separation of powers”. Trump’s tweets echoed remarks he made last week in a telephone interview with Fox News in which he said “they have this witch-hunt going on with people in the justice department that shouldn’t be there. They have a witch-hunt against the president of the United States going on”. He added: “I’ve taken the position, and I don’t have to take this position, and maybe I’ll change, that I will not be involved with the justice department.”
