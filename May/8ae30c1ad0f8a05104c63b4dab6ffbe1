Four British actors will battle it out at this year’s Tony awards in New York, recognised for the Broadway transfers of their hit London productions. Jamie Parker (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child), Mark Rylance (Farinelli and the King), Tom Hollander (Travesties) and Andrew Garfield (Angels in America) will compete against Denzel Washington (The Iceman Cometh) in the category. They are nominated for playing, respectively, a boy wizard who has grown up, a sleep-deprived King Philippe V of Spain, a minor consular official in Zurich and a gay New Yorker with Aids who journeys to heaven. British actors, playwrights, designers and directors have all been recognised in this year’s nominations. Glenda Jackson is up for best actress for her acclaimed performance in Edward Albee’s psychodrama Three Tall Women, which marked the former Labour MP’s return to Broadway after an absence of three decades. Jackson will compete against Amy Schumer (who starred in Steve Martin’s comedy Meteor Shower), Condola Rashad (Saint Joan) and Lauren Ridloff (Children of a Lesser God). The National Theatre’s much-revered revival of Tony Kushner’s two-part “gay fantasia” Angels in America received a total of 11 nominations: Marianne Elliott is in the running for best director, Susan Brown and Denise Gough are both up for best actress in a featured role in a play, and Nathan Lane is nominated for his performance as Roy Cohn, former attorney to Donald Trump. Ian MacNeil and Edward Pierce are shortlisted for their scenic design, which features three revolving sets, and Paule Constable’s lighting design – which features a series of striking fluorescent tubes – has also been nominated. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is currently running in London’s West End with a different cast while its original stars perform in the Broadway transfer, received 10 nominations. They include best play, best director (John Tiffany), best scenic design (Christine Jones), best costume design (Katrina Lindsay) and best choreography (Steven Hoggett). Noma Dumezweni, who plays Hermione, is nominated for best performance by an actress in a featured role in a play. Set 19 years after the last Harry Potter book, with Harry’s son struggling through a new term at Hogwarts, the two-part play is written by Jack Thorne, based on an original new story by JK Rowling, Thorne and Tiffany. In her five-star review, the Guardian’s New York critic Alexis Soloski called it “exuberantly, flabbergastingly theatrical”. It has broken box-office records on Broadway and the London production, still one of the West End’s hottest tickets, became the most awarded show ever at the Olivier awards last year, taking nine prizes. Anthony Boyle, who won an Olivier for best supporting actor for his portrayal of Scorpius Malfoy, son of Draco, is nominated for a Tony this year. The best director category includes nominations for Joe Mantello, best known as an actor, for his staging of Three Tall Women, and Patrick Marber, best known as a playwright, for his staging of Tom Stoppard’s exquisitely intricate comedy Travesties. George C Wolfe is also nominated for directing The Iceman Cometh, a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s towering drama set in a New York saloon. Lucy Kirkwood is nominated for best play for her post-apocalyptic drama The Children, starring Deborah Findlay (also nominated for her performance), which originally ran at the Royal Court in London. Also in the best play category is Claire van Kampen’s Farinelli and the King, which opened at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse back in 2015 and then transferred to the West End before heading to Broadway. Two new American musicals share the tally for most Tony nominations this year: Mean Girls, based on Tina Fey’s 2004 teen movie, and SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical, based on the animated TV show set underwater. Both have received 12 nominations each. The Band’s Visit, a new musical about a group of Egyptian musicians who travel to a remote Israeli town, and a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Carousel have received 11 nominations each. A new stage version of Disney’s animated box-office smash Frozen receives three nominations including best music and lyrics for husband-and-wife team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Earlier this year, Robert Lopez became the first person to achieve “double EGOT” status , recognised for twice winning Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards. Special Tony awards will be presented this year to John Leguizamo, “for his body of work and for his commitment to the theatre, bringing diverse stories and audiences to Broadway for three decades”, and to Bruce Springsteen for his one-man show Springsteen on Broadway which combines music and storytelling. As previously announced, the 2018 special Tony award for lifetime achievement in the theatre will be presented to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Chita Rivera. The Tony nominations were announced on 1 May by the actors Leslie Odom Jr and Katharine McPhee. The awards are handed out on 10 June in a ceremony hosted by Sara Bareilles and Josh Groban at Radio City Music Hall in New York.
