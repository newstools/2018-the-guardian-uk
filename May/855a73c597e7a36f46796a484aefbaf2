One of Britain’s most wanted fugitives has been arrested in Barcelona by officers investigating suspected drug dealing, police have said. Jamie Acourt, a former suspect in the original Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry, faces extradition proceedings in Madrid. On Friday evening, Scotland Yard said Acourt had been arrested by Spanish police acting on the Met’s behalf after an operation that also involved the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA). “Acourt thought he could evade capture but, as a result of an intelligence-led operation, his days on the run have ended,” said Ian Cruxton, the head of international operations for the NCA. “We were able to direct the Spanish authorities to his location in Barcelona. “Our ability to share information and work at speed with our international partners ensures there is no safe haven for fugitives. We will never stop pursuing these individuals.” The 41-year-old was arrested by armed officers as he left Barcelona’s Metropolitan Sagrada Familia gym on Friday afternoon, police said. Acourt, along with his brother Neil, was named to police among the prime suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry. He has always maintained his innocence. The NCA said he was the 81st fugitive to be located out of 96 publicised through Operation Captura – targeting the most wanted in Spain. Acourt, who was apprehended on a European arrest warrant, will appear at a court in Madrid next week for an extradition hearing.
