Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah will be fit to feature in the World Cup group stages, according to the Egyptian Football Association. The forward looked unlikely to play any part in the summer tournament after sustaining a shoulder injury in the first half of Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat against Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday night before leaving the field in tears. The EFA president, Hani Abu Reda, the national team coach Hector Cuper and doctor Mohamed Abou El-Ela met Salah on Wednesday in Valencia, where the 25-year-old is undergoing treatment and rehabilitation. A post on the federation’s Facebook page read: “The delegation of the national team was briefed on the recovery programme for the player, who is walking well and aims to join the squad in the World Cup, as well as the determination of the great player to catch up with his team-mates. For his part, Mohamed Abou El-Ela said that the period of absence of Salah due to injury will not exceed three weeks.” Egypt’s opening World Cup match takes place on 15 June against Uruguay, with their second against the hosts Russia coming four days later. Should Salah not return in time for either of those games, he could still appear in Egypt’s final group match against Saudi Arabia on 25 June.
