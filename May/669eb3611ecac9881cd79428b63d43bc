Terry Gilliam, the former Monty Python member and director of films such as Brazil and Time Bandits, has suffered a minor stroke. He is said to be recovering well in London after falling ill over the weekend, returning home from hospital on the evening of 8 May. Gilliam was discharged the day before a French court ruled that the world premiere of his new film, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, could go ahead as the closing gala of the Cannes film festival on 19 May. The film, which has been in the making since 1989 and has a reputation as one of the most unlucky productions in screen history, has been the subject of a distribution rights disagreement. Producer Paulo Branco had launched a legal challenge on 25 April to stop the screening and its French cinema release, claiming that his company Alfama Films owns the rights. On 8 May, Amazon Studios pulled out of US distribution, despite contributing significant funding. However, the court ruled in Gilliam’s favour, dismissing Branco’s attempt to gain an injunction to stop the screening at Cannes and other French cinemas. Before the court decision came through, the festival said it backed Gilliam and was proceeding as planned with the premiere. The Guardian has approached Gilliam’s representatives for comment.
