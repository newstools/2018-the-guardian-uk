Kevin De Bruyne believes Manchester City’s feat in reaching 100 points may be impossible to repeat, though he says this should be the challenge for Pep Guardiola’s side next season. Gabriel Jesus’s stoppage-time winner against Southampton at St Mary’s on Sunday enabled the Premier League champions to become the first club to reach that mark in England’s top division. “We all knew if we get 100 points it would be something so special and it is probably very difficult to manage again,” De Bruyne said. “It was the only thing to play for and, if you end the season that way, last minute, last kick of the season, and you get 100 points, it feels unbelievable. “In the end we broke the record – 100 points is something special. Three digits is very difficult to manage again and to be part of that means a lot.” Arsenal won the 2003-04 title unbeaten but with 90 points. Asked to compare City with that Arsène Wenger side, De Bruyne said: “We have the most points ever and with the competition you have with all the big teams it is very tough and to get 100 points and lose only 14 in the whole season is something special.” Guardiola has spoken of the need to try to retain the title next season, which only Manchester United and Chelsea have done in the Premier League era. De Bruyne echoed this. “You all start from nil again and to do the same [100 points] is probably impossible but we have to try,” the Belgian said. De Bruyne’s pass for Jesus’s goal on Sunday meant he claimed the inaugural Premier League award for the season’s most assists – 16 – one more than his City team-mate, Leroy Sané. Speaking during City’s open-top bus parade through Deansgate on Monday, Guardiola added: “Now is the time to enjoy what we’ve done this season. This summer we’ll watch the World Cup on the sofa - we’ll have some good beer, good red wine. Then we’ll try to come back stronger than this season.”
