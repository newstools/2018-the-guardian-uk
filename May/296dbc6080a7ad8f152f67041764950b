Two pictures have been released documenting the early days of Britain’s newest prince, one showing Prince Louis being cuddled by his three-year-old sister, Princess Charlotte. One of the photos was snapped when Louis was just three days old. He was born on 23 April and went home the same day. The two snapshots were released by Prince William and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, and were taken by Kate at their home in Kensington Palace. Big brother Prince George, four, is not in the photos. A palace statement said on Sunday that William and the duchess were “very pleased” to share the photos. It said the royal couple wanted to thank the public for “all the kind messages” received since Louis’ birth.
