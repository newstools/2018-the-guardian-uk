An intoxicated man’s ill-advised decision to spend a night on a freight train caused disruption for commuters in Munich as police had to suspend services at a busy station to look for him. Munich police said they received an emergency call at 5.20am from a man who reported that he had woken up in a container on a train near Pasing station, Munich’s third-largest, and could not get out. They said the 25-year-old man had been so drunk when he entered the container that he was not sure where it was. Police shut down all rail traffic and searched train by train, eventually finding him at 6.20am. Eighty-six trains were affected and there were a total of 1,280 minutes of delays, 37 cancellations and 21 partial cancellations. The man faces trespass-related charges.
