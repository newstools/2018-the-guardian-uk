Acclaimed 26-year-old chef António Galapito returned from London (where he worked with Nuno Mendes) to open Prado in November 2017. An abandoned fish factory was converted into this stylish, high-ceilinged restaurant, with Roman ruins on display – discovered the during renovation. Prado means meadow and Galapito’s mission is to celebrate local, seasonal produce, with small plates accompanied by organic and biodynamic wines. The menu offers a modern take on the traditional: dishes such as cockles, spinach, coriander and fried bread (€5.50) and Iberico pork tenderloin with quince and chocolate peppers (€10) are pretty as a picture and delicious. Don’t skip dessert, the sweet potato with smoked milk ice-cream and honey (€5) is fantastic.• Travessa das Pedras Negras 2, Baixa, +351 210 534 649, pradorestaurante.com, closed Mondays and Tuesdays The brincos (squid tentacles with coriander, €13.50) are so good here that people call ahead to ask for a portion to be saved; and the arroz de choco (cuttlefish rice, €17) is arguably the best in town. Vasco Hipóliot took over the popular, traditional Bota Velha (which he used to visit as a child) but has kept the old-school vibe – with wooden booths and beams intact. Homemade pastel de massa tenra (€2.20 each), fish soup (€12) and croquets with dijon mustard (€1.80 each) are other menu stars – and there are great cocktails, too. Kick-off with a rum sour, served with chilli jam and orange. This place opened last spring and Hipóliot has stellar credentials: he also owns upmarket seaside fish restaurant Sal in Comporta.• Rua Domingos Sequeira 38, Estrela, +351 21 390 4447, on Facebook, closed Mondays With its speakeasy vibe – dark purple walls, mismatched furniture from owner Victor Cordeiro’s grandparents’ house, a 1920s soundtrack, candlelight – you could while away the hours here, sipping wine and sampling petiscos (the Portuguese version of tapas).

Other specialities include flaming chorizo (€6.50), various bruschetta (€4.50) and homemade smoked salmon carpaccio (€13). The extensive Portuguese wine list offers lots by the glass too.
