Two Qantas flights had a near miss in Perth when one crossed a runway into the path of another jet that was commencing takeoff. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the serious incident, which occurred on Saturday after a Qantas flight from Sydney landed and nearly cut across a departing plane. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The pilot of the arriving aircraft had to brake hard as the other jet, travelling to Sydney, was forced to abort takeoff. An initial report from the ATSB said the aircraft that landed was supposed to stop short at a holding point before the runway but the pilots kept going until air traffic controllers told them to brake immediately. The close shave occurred in an area known as a runway incursion “hotspot”, the ATSB said. Qantas said it would review the incident, and is assisting the bureau with its investigation. The final report is expected in a year. This week, Qantas announced it would retire the last of its Boeing 747s by the end of 2020. It will buy six more Boeing Dreamliners, which are 20% more fuel-efficient. Qantas’s third-quarter revenue rose 7.5% and it expects a full-year underlying pre-tax profit of between $1.55bn and $1.60bn. That would beat the record $1.5bn it reported in 2016. Last year’s profit was $1.4bn. The airline’s shares, which have trebled in value over the past three and a half years, rose 6.2% to $6.16.
