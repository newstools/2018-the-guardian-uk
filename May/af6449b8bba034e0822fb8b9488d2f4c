Before I got pregnant, we had a very adventurous sex life. We had a lot of toys, we’d spend whole days in bed and even went to sex parties. We’ve only been together a few years, so having a baby came as a shock. We’re still very tactile and loving, but with a six-month-old baby any sex we have tends to be under time pressure because we both need our sleep. I’m also breastfeeding. At first I wore my bra in bed and wouldn’t let my husband play with my breasts, which was strange as that had been a large part of our foreplay. Mentally, it takes me longer to get aroused now, as I’ve spent most of the day in “mum” mode. I also hated the way I looked when I was pregnant. I felt huge, with these pendulous breasts that seemed alien. My husband was kind and supportive, and told me I looked beautiful, but in my head I didn’t feel like myself. We are getting there. The baby is sleeping longer, so I have a bit more energy. My vagina has recovered from the birth so I’ve started exercising again, and I feel more confident in my body. I have updated my wardrobe, and while my breasts are still on the large side, they no longer feel like cartoon boobs drawn by a teenage boy. Our sex is infrequent and less adventurous, but it’s still there, like a pot that’s been put on a back burner for a while, simmering away. We just need to keep it bubbling along, so that once we’ve left the fog of young parenthood, we can revive some of our adventures together. I look longingly at our drawer full of toys (now with child lock).  • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours? Email sex@theguardian.com
