Liverpool will step up their pursuit of Nabil Fekir after the Champions League final as they look to secure the £70m-rated Lyon captain before the World Cup. Fekir, who has played as an attacking midfielder and forward for his hometown club, is a major summer target for Jürgen Klopp with the Liverpool manager yet to replace Philippe Coutinho. Liverpool’s finances will also be swelled by around £70m for reaching Saturday’sChampions League final against Real Madrid. Klopp has already signed Naby Keita from Red Bull Leipzig for this summer, with the Guinea midfielder costing £52.75m, but is keen to strengthen his midfield options in order to challenge Manchester City for next season’s Premier League title. The 24-year-old Fekir has enjoyed another excellent season in France and earned a call-up to Didier Deschamps’ World Cup squad. The France international is aware of Liverpool’s interest and, when asked about a possible transfer to Anfield by RTL replied: “Why not?”
