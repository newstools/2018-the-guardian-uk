France is to introduce a national lottery to pay for the restoration of decaying historic buildings and works of art, the president has announced. Emmanuel Macron launched the plan for special €15 “heritage” scratchcardsafter visiting the €9m (£8m) restoration Voltaire’s chateau in Ferney, near the Swiss border. Voltaire was fiercely proud of the property, acquired in 1759 after he had fallen out of favour with the French court. The philosopher talked of transforming the village of Ferney from what he called “a miserable hamlet surrounded by marshes” into a place where key figures in Europe would flock to see him. It was here that Voltaire wrote his Treatise on Tolerance, published in 1763, whose ideas would later be paraphrased as “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it”. Macron was advised on the heritage plan by his friend Stéphane Bern, a TV historian and royal commentator. A commission sifted through hundreds of applications to choose the sites that would benefit from proceeds from the scratchcards. Those selected include the Caribbean home of Aimé Césaire, the Martinican intellectual, poet and politician, and the eccentric, fantasy-filled home of the writer and adventurer Pierre Loti in Rochefort, on the west coast of France – particularly to fix the roof of its second floor, decorated with artefacts from Syria and Turkey. Other places include an 18th-century fortress on a tiny Brittany island, a 12th-century Burgundy castle and a Roman aqueduct in eastern France. France has a heritage budget of €326m a year. The culture minister, Françoise Nyssen, said she saw the lottery – which could raise €15m-€20m – as extra funding for sites in particular need. The lottery will be held in September for a limited period and repeated the following year.
