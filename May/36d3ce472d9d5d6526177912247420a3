Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale cast significant doubt in their futures at Real Madrid in the midst of celebrations at the end of the Champions League final. Bale said he needed to be a regular starter and would talk to his agent about his options and Ronaldo referred to his time at the club in the past tense and said that he would make a statement in the coming days. The future of each may depend in part upon the other. Bale, who came on and scored twice to win the European Cup, said: “I need to be playing week in week out, and that’s not happened this season for one reason or another. I had a five- or six-week injury at the start of the season and I’ve been fit ever since so now I have to sit down in the summer and discuss it with my agent and take it from there.” Ronaldo too appeared to say that his future lies elsewhere. “It’s been very nice to be at Madrid,” he said. “In the coming days I will give a response to the fans because they actually have always been at my side.” Ronaldo’s mention of the fans was probably designed to highlight the difference between their support and what he perceives as a lack of support from the president, Florentino Pérez. This is not the first time he has expressed unhappiness and suggested that he wants to leave, only to stay rather than following through on his threats. Rarely though has he spoken as openly. Pérez responded by saying: “Now is not the time for individual issues. There’s always lots of noise and then nothing happens.” Ronaldo was outspoken too on the future of the European Cup: “The Champions League should change and be called the CR7 Champions League. I have won five and I am the [top] goalscorer again.” He later expressed regret at the timing of his comments regarding his future but said he had talked from the heart and that he would make the statement he promised. “I’ll speak,” he added. “I can’t hide that [I have something to say]. It wasn’t the right moment because of the history of the club.”
