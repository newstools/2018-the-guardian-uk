Southampton have poked fun at the hotel that cancelled their booking before their crucial game against Swansea City on Tuesday by endorsing a critical review of the venue on Twitter. The south coast club were bitterly upset after being prevented from staying at the Marriott Hotel in Swansea but they had the last laugh after Manolo Gabbiadini’s winner at the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday all but secured Southampton’s Premier League status and left Swansea City on the brink of relegation to the Championship. Having used the inconvenience as a motivational tool, Southampton can afford to look on the funny side now and they got their own back by tweeting a photo of a TripAdvisor review from a supporter who said they also had their booking cancelled by the Marriott. “Just some feedback” the club tweeted. The poster used Southampton’s crest as their profile picture and appeared to make references to Swansea’s heartbreaking defeat in a one-star review which has since been deleted by TripAdvisor. “Had been due to stay here for an extremely important business trip, only to have our reservation cancelled 24 hours before arrival, due to an apparent virus outbreak,” the poster, who used WeMarchOn as a pseudonym, said. “Very disappointing, as other guests’ bookings seemed to be unaffected – Fortunately the experience didn’t sour our trip. Business meeting was extremely productive! Not planning to return any time soon.” Mark Hughes said after the game that “dark arts” were at play, although the Southampton manager stressed that he apportioned no blame to Swansea for the cancellation. “I’m not for one minute suggesting Swansea had anything to do with that,” Hughes said. “It’s just maybe over-zealous Swansea fans in positions to affect our hotel booking. But those things you can use to your own benefit and use as a motivating factor.”
