The Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, has delivered an emotional apology in parliament to people convicted under past gay sex laws. Gunner said gay people had been forced to live in fear and secrecy and their lives and careers had been ruined. “Today is about making right,” he said. “It is about [making right] hurtful and discriminatory laws tolerated, supported or actively perpetuated by Northern Territory governments ... We were wrong.” Gunner said the apology could not repair or reverse the damage, including the lives that were lost. But he is seeking to pass a bill that would have the records expunged of gay people historically convicted of consensual sex. This would go some way towards helping people now, he said, adding the NT was a “beautiful, diverse and welcoming place”. Gunner became tearful when mentioning that his sister Lucy would marry her female partner this year. A group of people in the public gallery cheered loudly. The NT voted 61% in favour of same-sex marriage last year. Anna Brown, director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the apology would help to heal past wounds. “It’s never too late to put things right,” she said. “There was a time when governments around Australia turned thousands of innocent men and women into criminals all because of who they love. It was profoundly cruel and wrong.”
