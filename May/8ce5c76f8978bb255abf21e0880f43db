The first official photos of the newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been released by Kensington Palace. Taken by Alexi Lubomirski, the photos include one depicting the couple with the page boys and flower girls who assisted them during Saturday’s ceremony. A second image features other members of the royal household, including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. Prince Harry’s brother, William, Duke of Cambridge, who acted as best man at the weekend also features, alongside their father, Prince Charles. The picture also features Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, who was the only member of her close family to attend the ceremony. A final picture shows the couple smiling together on the east terrace of Windsor Castle. Photographer Lubomirski is himself royalty, through the lineage of the Polish House of Lubomirski – his official title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski. He also took the couple’s official engagement photos last year.
