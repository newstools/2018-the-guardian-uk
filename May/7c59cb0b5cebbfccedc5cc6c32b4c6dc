Authorities believe up to half a dozen bodies of missing girls could be buried in a wooded area north-east of Detroit. Digging resumed on Tuesday in Macomb Township, about 30 miles from downtown Detroit. Warren police commissioner Bill Dwyer told WJBK-TV officers were searching for the remains of 12-year-old Kimberly King, who last was seen in 1979. “We have probable cause to believe that she is buried there,” Dwyer said. “We also believe that there’s maybe four to six other girls that have been reported missing that are buried there. We certainly are convinced we have the right area. It’s just a sad type of situation.” King lived in the Detroit suburb of Warren, as did 13-year-old Cindy Zarzycki, who disappeared in 1986 after being lured to a Dairy Queen. Arthur Ream led police to the area and Zarzycki’s remains in 1986. Zarzycki had been dating Ream’s son at the time of her disappearance. Authorities said Ream tricked her by telling her that he was planning a surprise party for his son. Ream, 68, was convicted of first-degree murder and is serving life in prison. He already was serving time for a separate 1996 criminal sexual conduct case. Dwyer did not give the names of the other missing girls.
