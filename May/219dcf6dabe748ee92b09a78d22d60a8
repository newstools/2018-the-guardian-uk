A woman broke her arm during a female arm-wrestling competition at a young farmers’ event, causing her opponent to faint at the sight. The 20-year-old was taking part in the activity at the Young Farmers’ Clubs northern district field day in Irthington, Cumbria, on Saturday. Paramedics from Kentdale First Aid company in Kendal were called to the scene. Andrew Dickinson, a paramedic, said the woman’s opponent was very upset and fainted when she realised what had happened. “She broke her arm while wrestling with another girl. It was a bad break and she was in a lot of pain,” Dickinson told the BBC. “The other girl realised she had broken her arm and fainted.” The woman with the broken arm was taken by ambulance to Cumberland infirmary in Carlisle. The arm-wrestling competition was one of more than 100 events at the annual gathering, which was attended by more than 800 young farmers from 15 clubs across north and west Cumbria. Farmers demonstrated skills ranging from stock judging to tractor handling, bale stacking, sheep shearing, tug-of-war and flower arranging. Dickinson said the rest of the day was “fantastic”. “It ended with a dance which 600 people attended and we were on site until 1.30am,” he said. The Cumbria Federation of Young Farmers, which hosted the event, is made up of 25 regional clubs open to those aged 10 to 26. It also welcomes non-farmers, and organises charity events, festivals and competitions.
