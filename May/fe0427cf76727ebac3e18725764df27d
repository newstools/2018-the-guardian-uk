Tony Bellew pushed David Haye in the throat as tensions boiled over at the pair’s final heavyweight rematch pre-fight press conference for Saturday’s bout at the O2 Arena in London. Bellew shoved his right arm into Haye’s throat as they went head-to-head with security staff having to restore order between the pair, who had come to blows at a press conference before their first fight. Earlier Haye insisted he has learned from his mistakes as he aims to conclusively end his rivalry with Bellew. Haye was stopped by his heavyweight rival in the 11th round at the same venue 14 months ago before being fined by the British Boxing Board of Control for his behaviour in the build-up. The Londoner has adopted a more measured and respectful approach this time around as he attempts to revive his career in this Saturday’s rematch. He said: “I’ve learned from my mistakes, inside and outside the ring. This time around it may not be as controversial. It will be a little more clinical. I’ve kept my game-plan under wraps, but it’s to do as much damage over the first six rounds. Then step it up. “Being in there with him first time around, the shots that were missing, will be landing. I will give you the performance a lot of people expected first time around.” Bellew said: “He looks good, his team are confident, like last time, but we will see. I just want to punch him. He would love nothing more than to knock every tooth out of my mouth, don’t be fooled, the mask comes off on Saturday. “We are going to go and Haye will have to do things he doesn’t want to do. I will do anything to win and you will see. There’s going to be no rematch this time, your career is over. What matters is that you end on Saturday night.” WOW 😮😮Tony Bellew shoves David Haye as the #BellewHaye2 presser kicks off! 🥊 pic.twitter.com/4wBSLiOdNK James Buckley, who played Jay in the popular TV programme The Inbetweeners, interrupted the press conference to mock Haye’s promoter, Adam Moralee. An outburst from Moralee at Monday’s press conference led to him being compared to The Inbetweeners character Will McKenzie. Buckley brought Moralee a briefcase and glasses similar to those McKenzie wore in the television series and two films. He then told Bellew: “He’s [Will’s] a mate of mine. Have a bit of respect – if you want to pick on someone your own size, by all means stand up.” The former WBC cruiserweight champion, who laughed throughout, responded “You look too big for me, mate,” before later adding: “Jesus Christ, that threw me off.”
