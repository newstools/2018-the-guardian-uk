Israel erupted this weekend into a state of national exhilaration – expressed with chicken-inspired dance moves – following Netta Barzilai’s win at the Eurovision song contest. Fans poured into the streets of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Sunday after the 25-year-old was announced a champion in Lisbon for her techno dance tune Toy, a pop anthem filled with clucks and synthesised beats. Exuberant crowds blocked traffic and many jumped into the public fountain at Rabin Square in front of city hall to rejoice in the win for the national sensation who had previously sung with the Israeli navy band. החגיגות לכבוד נטע נמשכות לתוך הלילה - נתראה בשנה הבאה בישראל! pic.twitter.com/UEHjhIuNwJ At bars lining the covered Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem, partygoers danced to loudspeakers blaring the track. Many sang the lyrics: “I’m not your toy, you stupid boy”.

I love my country. Next time in Jerusalem,” Barzilai yelled as she held her trophy after her win. Public figures across the country rushed to express their glee. Gal Gadot, an Israeli actor who played Wonder Woman, said Netta represented “the real wonder in women”. Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, called to congratulate Barzilai, saying she was the country’s “greatest ambassador”. On Sunday morning, the prime minister attempted the chicken dance for reporters. ראש הממשלה @netanyahu במחווה מיוחדת ל@NettaBarzilai pic.twitter.com/0TJFxPcK16 At his cabinet meeting, Netanyahu opened by saying “boker Toy”, instead of “boker tov”, which means “good morning”. “These days Jerusalem is being blessed with many gifts,” the prime minister said. “We received another one last night with Netta’s thrilling and suspenseful victory. The gift is that Eurovision will come to Jerusalem next year; we will be very proud to host it.” President Reuven Rivlin said on Facebook: “Proud of you, dear Netta. Waiting for everyone next year in Jerusalem!”. Following an energetic electronic dance performance, Barzilai was awarded 529 points, beating favourites Cyprus into second place. Winners are decided through a mix of juries and viewer votes. The beatboxing looping artist, whose song was inspired by the #MeToo movement, is the first Israeli to win since 1998 when performer Dana International broke ground as the first transgender winner of the contest. Thank you Europe. The win comes during a period of significant focus on Jerusalem, the eastern part of which Israeli forces captured in 1967 and later annexed. Israel claims all of Jerusalem and Donald Trump has sent his daughter, Ivanka, to the Monday opening of Washington’s new embassy there. The moved follows the US president’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, breaking with generations of international consensus that the holy city’s status should be settled as part of a two-state peace deal with the Palestinians.

The Speaker of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, said Netta’s victory had brought national pride. “Not only the embassy is coming to Jerusalem, but the Eurovision too!” Yuli-Yoel Edelstein said on Saturday night.
