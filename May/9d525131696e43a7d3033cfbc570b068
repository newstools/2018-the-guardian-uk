Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, has been granted Israeli citizenship and will move to Tel Aviv, according to local media reports. Abramovich’s British visa had expired and sources told the Reuters news agency it was taking longer than usual to get it renewed. The British government has declined to comment on his case. The Times of Israel said that Israel’s interior ministry confirmed the development on Monday. According to the Ynet website, which belongs to Israel’s biggest selling daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, Abramovich flew to Tel Aviv on Monday and received documents confirming his status as an Israeli citizen. He has reportedly bought a property in the city. An Israeli immigration absorption ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the report, citing individual privacy. But a spokeswoman for the Population Administration, which oversees border control, confirmed to Reuters that Abramovich was in Israel. His spokesman also declined to comment. Israel grants citizenship to any Jewish person wishing to move there and a passport can be issued immediately. Israeli passport holders can enter Britain without a visa for short stays, although they require visas to work there. Relations between Moscow and London have been strained since the poisoning of former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal in Britain in March, an act Britain has blamed on Russia but in which the Kremlin denies any involvement. Abramovich has been a regular visitor to Israel. Ynet said he had bought a former hotel in Tel Aviv, close to the Mediterranean coast.
