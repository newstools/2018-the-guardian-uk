Comcast has confirmed it is preparing to top Disney’s $52bn bid for 21st Century Fox. The US pay TV giant, which is also mounting a separate £22bn bid to take control of Sky, said it is in “advanced stages” of preparing an all-cash offer for the entertainment and broadcast assets that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. Comcast put in a $60bn bid for Fox last year, a 16% premium to Disney’s offer, but Rupert Murdoch rejected it, citing regulatory concerns and share structure. The Murdochs will control about 5% of Disney, if that deal goes through. “Comcast Corporation confirms that it is considering, and is in advanced stages of preparing, an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney,” the company said. “Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney. The structure and terms of any offer by Comcast … would be at least as favourable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer.” Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, said it has not made a final decision on whether to make a formal offer but that the work on financing a bid and making regulatory findings are “well advanced”.
