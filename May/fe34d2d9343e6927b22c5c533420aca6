The anti-abortion save the 8th campaign has conceded defeat in the Irish referendum, as new laws look likely in the country. The first official results began to be announced from early afternoon on Saturday, with local returning officers reporting their constituency results to the referendum returning officer, who will formally declare the national result at Dublin Castle when all 40 constituencies are in. We would like you to share your thoughts on the result and the situation in the country. How do you feel about the result? Was it what you expected? What do you think will happen next?
