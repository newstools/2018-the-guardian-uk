Egypt’s antiquities ministry has said new radar scans provide conclusive evidence that there are no hidden rooms inside King Tutankhamun’s burial chamber. Mostafa Waziri, the secretary general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, said an Italian team had conducted extensive studies with ground-penetrating radar that showed the tomb did not contain any hidden, manmade blocking walls, as was earlier suspected. In 2015 after analysis of high-definition laser scans, a British Egyptologist, Nicholas Reeves, proposed that Queen Nefertiti’s tomb could be concealed behind wall paintings in the boy king’s burial chamber. The ministry said previous scans by Japanese and American scientists had proved inconclusive.
