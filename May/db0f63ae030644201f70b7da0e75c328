Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, has brushed off criticism over the Apu character, saying that people love to fake taking offence. In an interview with USA Today, Groening was asked if he had anything to say about the row, which started when Hari Kondabolu – a standup comic from New York – made a documentary about how the character was used to bully him when he was growing up. “Not really,” Groening said. “I’m proud of what we do on the show. And I think it’s a time in our culture where people love to pretend they’re offended.” Groening is the latest member of The Simpsons camp to comment on the criticism. Hank Azaria, who plays Apu, said he would consider stepping aside so that a south Asian actor could take over the role. Azaria said: “I think the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it … I’m perfectly willing to step aside. It just feels like the right thing to do to me.” Azaria’s comments followed The Simpsons’ own response to the Apu criticism. In an episode that aired in early April, a scene referenced Kondabolu’s comments. It ended with a picture of Apu with the phrase: “Don’t have a cow,” on it. Kondabolu responded to the scene on Twitter. He tweeted: “Wow. ‘Politically incorrect?’ That’s the takeaway from my movie and the discussion it sparked? Man, I really loved this show. This is sad.” Earlier this month, Al Jean, the executive producer of The Simpsons, said that he would “try to find an answer” to the controversy. “I truly appreciate all responses, pro and con,” he tweeted. “[I] will continue to try to find an answer that is popular [and] more important right.” This week, The Simpsons surpassed Gunsmoke’s record for having the most episodes of a scripted prime-time series in the US – its latest episode was the 636th. Groening has an animated series, Disenchantment, coming to Netflix in 2018. It is set in a rundown medieval kingdom.
