The draw for the 24-team event was made in Dubai on Friday with top-seeded Australia facing Syria and Jordan, who they met en route to qualification for the World Cup in Russia, and Palestine, in Group B. Jordan inflicted a 2-0 defeat on the Socceroos in 2015 with Syria proving to be stubborn opponents in the inter-continental play-off in Sydney when Tim Cahill pounced in extra-time to seal a 3-2 aggregate victory. Arnold will take over from Bert van Marwijk after the World Cup in what will be his second Asian Cup in charge, having led the team in their disappointing 2007 campaign.

The competition has been expanded to 24 nations and will see the Philippines, Yemen and Kyrgyzstan make their debuts. The Asian Cup takes place in seven stadiums in four UAE cities from 5 January.
