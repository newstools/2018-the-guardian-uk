A young man who killed four people and injured seven others in shootings at a school and a home in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan was sentenced on Tuesday to life in prison, with no chance of parole for 10 years. The gunman, who was weeks away from his 18th birthday when he killed two teenage brothers, a teacher and a teacher’s aide in La Loche, Saskatchewan, was sentenced as an adult. Judge Janet McIvor said the January 2016 shootings were “senseless” and “coldly horrific”. The shooter’s name is still protected under a publication ban until his appeal options are exhausted. He pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder. Brothers Dayne and Drayden Fontaine were killed in their home before the teen went to the school, where he gunned down teacher Adam Wood and teacher’s aide Marie Janvier. The shooter began formulating a plan as early as September 2015, McIvor said. He researched different kinds of guns and the damage they could do to people. “His months of planning were over in a matter of minutes,” she said. McIvor said the shootings had had a great impact in the northern community, with fewer teachers willing to work there and an increase in substance abuse and suicides. The young man, who is now 20, will be eligible for parole in 10 years. Speaking at the hearing in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, the man said: “I can’t undo what I did. I’m sorry.” He looked back at his family in the viewing gallery and said: “I’m sorry. I love you.” McIvor said she took his apology into account, as well as his guilty pleas which spared the victims’ families the pain of a trial. It will be up to the parole board to decide when or if he can be reintegrated into society. He has a “very, very, very long road ahead of him”, she said.
