We use the CEO’s office for private meetings as the rest of the office is open plan. He also never signs out of his email. I was meeting a client when I glanced at the screen and noticed the top email was notes on a meeting on my future in the business. I finished my meeting and read the notes. The gist was that I was wrong for the position but they were not certain what the position should be. Several of the options discussed were about making me redundant with one month’s notice; however the decision made was to set me clearer goals and have an honest conversation with me. I’ve since been issued with share options and no conversation has taken place. I’m deeply confused but unsure of whether or not to bring it up. I’ve had a year in the role, although I’ve been with the company much longer, and exceeded all my key performance indicators. I’m concerned their discussion may have to do with me having recently disclosed that I was suffering from depression. I’m planning to jump ship as soon as possible, but am wondering how I should handle it in the meantime. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Working It Out asking for help, and may well view your comments here. • If you have a problem at work, this is your chance to get some advice.
