Actor Jim Carrey has called Donald Trump a “melanoma” and said that the current administration is “raping our system”. In a strongly worded attack reported by the Hollywood Reporter during a panel discussion at the Vulture festival in Los Angeles, Carrey denounced Republicans while speaking about his interest in politically oriented painting. Carrey called Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell “incredibly dangerous, a threat to homeland security. And now he has the nerve to come out a couple of days ago and ask for bipartisanship.” During the discussion, Carrey posted a painting of McConnell on social media, depicting the politician as a turtle waving a white flag on which is written the word “Bipartisanship” while a wave – an allusion to the Democratic “blue wave” in the 2018 mid-term elections – threatens to swamp him. pic.twitter.com/PcmTusyiqk Carrey reportedly added, “These are not people you can deal with. You cannot be bipartisan with a criminal. A rapist needs to be removed, not negotiated with. These people are raping our system, they’re destroying it right in front of us … This corrupt Republican Congress that was … These people have to be removed from our system because they’re bad for us. Trump is a melanoma, and anybody that covers for him, including Sarah Sanders, is putting makeup on it. It shows that there’s a deeper problem in this country, and that problem is greed.” Carrey also had harsh words for the Christian right, saying: “I think they’re going to find out once and for all that the Christian right has never been about morality, it’s been about holding on to power and using morality to do so.” Carrey has produced a stream of artworks in the last few years, to less than resounding acclaim. He has recently posted pictures of Trump and vice president Mike Pence in space, Trump crucifying Jesus, and former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt vomiting oil.
