Raheem Sterling has verbally agreed a new five-year contract with Manchester City after months of talks. The forward, who has just over 18 months left on the deal he signed when joining from Liverpool, has been granted a substantial pay rise. Sterling’s wages are set to increase markedly from around £170,000 a week, reward for the form which has made him a key part of Pep Guardiola’s team. He set up Riyad Mahrez’s winner at Tottenham last Monday, a result which returned City to the top of the Premier League. The agreement will be welcomed by Guardiola, who said in September: “It’s well-known we’re delighted with him and would like him to continue. My club knows my opinion and we share that.”
