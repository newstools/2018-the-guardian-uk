The former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has issued an emotional denial on social media after it emerged he has been charged with sexually assaulting a woman on a train. The 51-year-old from Gateshead, who won 57 caps for England, was arrested at Durham station on 20 August. A spokeswoman for the force said: “A man is due to appear in court next month charged in connection with the sexual assault of a woman onboard a train from York to Durham.” It added that Gascoigne was charged “with one count of sexual assault by touching, contrary to section 3 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The charge relates to an incident onboard a train on 20 August this year.” Gascoigne denied the charge in a tweet on Monday, which was “liked” hundreds of times by fans within minutes of being posted. my niece&nephew who were hospitalised because they were called fat at school &refused2eat,I was called fat 😢 it’s ok I’m just sad about it as I respect all women I’ve a MAM2sisters2nieces a daughter so why assault x just so pleased that everyone I know they no it not true 😢😢 In 2017, Gascoigne was hailed a hero for confronting would-be housebreakers who were attempting to burgle the home of a neighbour in Poole, Dorset . In October, Gascoigne hit back at the Scottish Football Association after it emerged a vote to induct him into its hall of fame had been rescinded because some SFA board members had threatened to boycott a dinner to celebrate new inductees. Gascoigne, who helped Glasgow Rangers to two league titles during a three-year stint at the club, responded on Twitter: “I don’t need to be in The Scottish Hall of Fame to be be recognised as one of the best I feel the love & support of the People and know I was the best.” He will appear at Newton Aycliffe magistrates court on 11 December.
