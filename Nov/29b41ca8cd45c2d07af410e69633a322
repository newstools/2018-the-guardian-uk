The German edition of Playboy magazine has defended its claim to have interviewed Ennio Morricone, in which the celebrated film composer allegedly said Quentin Tarantino was a “cretin” and that his films were “trash”. In a statement issued to the Guardian, Playboy said: “We are surprised to hear that Ennio Morricone denies having given an interview to German Playboy. The conversation did in fact take place on 30 June 2018 at his property in Rome. The interview with German Playboy was arranged via the concert promotion company Semmel Concerts, who were also present. We are also confused by the claim that parts of the published statements were not made in this form.” After the online publication of excerpts from an article in Playboy Germany’s December edition, in which Morricone appeared to heavily criticise the director as well as the Oscars, Morricone issued a statement denying he had given an interview to Playboy Germany and threatening legal action. In another statement he said: “I consider Tarantino a great director. I am very fond of my collaboration with him and the relationship we have developed during the time we have spent together.” The article, timed to coincide with Morricone’s 90th birthday, is by music journalist Marcel Anders, and was briefly blocked on Playboy Germany’s website on Monday, but has now been restored. Anders also claims to have conducted an interview with Morricone for radio station Deutschelandfunk at the same time. Morricone won an Oscar for best score for his work on Tarantino’s 2015 western The Hateful Eight, after turning down previous requests from Tarantino for music for Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds.
