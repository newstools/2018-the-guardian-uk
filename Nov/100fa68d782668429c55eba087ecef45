Jürgen Klopp has said Uefa must take action against any club found to have flouted its rules on financial fair play. Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were accused of overvaluing sponsorship deals to meet FFP rules in articles published by the German magazine Der Spiegel this week. The allegations were based on documents released by Football Leaks and claimed Uefa was not aware of the extent of the alleged deception when, in City’s case, imposing a £49m fine – £32m of which was suspended – in 2014. City and PSG have denied wrongdoing. Klopp is the first high-profile Premier League manager other than Pep Guardiola to discuss FFP since the allegations. The Liverpool manager said on Friday he had yet to read Der Spiegel’s accusations but believes European football’s governing body must sanction any club in breach of the regulations for FFP to remain fit for purpose. “It is really difficult to comment but what I can say in general is that FFP is a really good thing,” Klopp said. “But we always thought that, if it is in place, they have to do something with it. I have no clue what happens. I know it is about Paris and Man City. I’m not sure if other clubs are being talked about. I think FFP is a really good thing because it sets the rules. If everything is fine, then everything is fine. If not, then somebody should do something. That’s all I can say but I have no clue about the real story.” Liverpool are in close competition with City and PSG in the Premier League and Champions League respectively. Klopp, however, rejected the idea that Liverpool’s rivals are not competing on a level playing field. “For me that is not important. We have better circumstances than other clubs. We have much better circumstances than Huddersfield, for example, but they don’t blame us and say we have to find a rule so we have the same situation. It’s not like that. If there are rules, then accept them.”
