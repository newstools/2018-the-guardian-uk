David Villa, one of MLS’s most successful imports, has announced an end to his New York City FC career. The club confirmed on Wednesday that the Spanish striker will leave NYC FC when his contract expires at the end of December. “My experience here was amazing,” said the 36-year-old. “It gave me everything as a soccer player, as a person, and as a family man. I’ll always remember this experience with love. My heart is here and I’m an NYC FC supporter forever.” Villa is in his fourth season at NYC FC, and was the club’s first foreign signing when he joined in June 2014. Unlike many foreign stars in MLS, Villa was still relatively young at 32 when he signed for the club. He quickly impressed fans with his goalscoring talent, something he had already established as he became Spain’s all-time leading scorer, and work-rate on the field. “David has been an incredible ambassador and captain to this Club since the moment we signed him. His professionalism and leadership helped us through the challenges that a new team faces when they come into the league,” said the club’s sporting director, Claudio Reyna. “He’s represented New York City FC tremendously both on and off the pitch and has been a real leader for this football club. “I truly believe that David will be remembered as one of the best players to ever play in MLS. He will forever be a legend amongst all of our wonderful supporters and everyone here at NYC FC wishes David nothing but the best in the remainder of his career. He will always be a part of NYC FC.” Villa scored 80 goals in 124 MLS appearances and was named the league’s most valuable player in 2016. He was recalled to the Spain squad in August 2017, three years after his original retirement from international football. Villa said he intends to continue playing but has not yet decided where that will be.
