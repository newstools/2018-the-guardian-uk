Bring a large, deep pot of water to the boil and salt it generously. Lower 125g of fettuccine into the water and let it cook until al dente. Finely chop 30g of coriander leaves then add them to 250ml of double cream in a saucepan. Warm the cream gently. Remove 250g of dressed crab from its shell and fold into the cream. Season with black pepper and a little salt. Drain the pasta thoroughly then fold it into the crab, coriander and cream sauce, tossing them gently together. The crab meat is already cooked. It needs only to warm for a few seconds in the hot coriander cream. Overcooking will lead to a woolly texture. In place of the crab meat, use smoked haddock that youâ€™ve cooked in a little milk and water (with a sliced onion, bay leaves and peppercorns) then broken into fat flakes. In this case I might think of using parsley in place of the coriander. Prawns, tossed in a little sizzling butter with finely ground mace, could also be folded into the pasta instead of the crab.
