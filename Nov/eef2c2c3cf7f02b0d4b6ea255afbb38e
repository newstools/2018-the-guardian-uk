Boston Celtics star Kyrie Irving has apologized after replying to a reporter who wished him a happy Thanksgiving after Wednesday’s loss to the New York Knicks by saying he doesn’t celebrate the holiday, adding “fuck Thanksgiving”. On Thursday Irving expressed regret over the comments. “I spoke w/ frustration after last nights game and spoke words that shouldn’t be in a professional setting no matter what,” he wrote on Twitter. “Meant no disrespect to the Holiday and those who celebrate it respectfully. I’m grateful for the time We all can share with our families. We are always ONE.” I spoke w/ frustration after last nights game and spoke words that shouldn’t be in a professional setting no matter what. Irving told NBC Sports Boston that he is opposed to the celebration of the holiday due to his Native American heritage. Many in the Native American community and beyond see the holiday as offensive, given the suffering and racism they have suffered since European colonization. Irving’s late mother, Elizabeth Ann Larson, was a member of the Standing Rock Sioux and lived on the tribe’s reservation until her adoption at a young age. In August, Irving and his sister became members of the tribe and he was given the name Little Mountain. Irving is a is a five-time NBA All-Star and won a championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. His Boston Celtics were tipped as one of the league’s best teams at the start of the season but have struggled in recent weeks and have lost seven of their last 10 games.
