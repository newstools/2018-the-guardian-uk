One rainy evening in London, Rob Hann was sitting at home watching a TV programme about modern art in Texas. Transfixed by the sunny blue skies and the sprawling desert landscapes, he decided to plan a road trip to America’s south-west. Usually a portrait photographer (his subjects range from Daft Punk and JG Ballard to Chloë Sevigny), on the road, Hann turned his lens to the strange sights along the way. He became particularly interested in signs, inspired in part by Ed Ruscha’s use of text in his paintings and Wim Wenders’s photography book Written in the West. When Hann saw the sign in the photo above, in Navajo Nation in northern Arizona, he immediately stopped the car. “I couldn’t pass it without taking the picture,” he says. “There’s the upbeat nature of it, the mysteriousness of it.” To this day, he does not know what the “Really Really Good” is referring to: perhaps a brand of beef jerky, or Native American jewellery. “My photographs are generally very simple in their composition, but I like there to be something else going on behind them, a little twist, where you have a question.” Hann started photographing the US in October 2001, weeks after 9/11. “There was a lot of nervousness,” he says. “The whole country felt like it had been attacked.” Two years later he moved to New York City, where he still lives, and since 2010 his work has focused exclusively on road trips. For his next one he plans to set off on New Year’s Day, driving from California to Florida and back again. “I get up before it’s light and drive until it’s dark. From looking at the pictures, it seems like there’s this abundance of stuff out there, but sometimes I’ll have to drive 300 miles before I see something interesting.” Rob Hann’s book Diesel Fried Chicken is available via robhann.com
