The countdown to Brexit has seen the number of workers in Britain from the former communist countries of eastern Europe fall at its sharpest rate since modern records began more than two decades ago. Official figures covering the summer and early autumn showed a 154,000 drop over the past year in the number of people employed from eight countries – including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic – that joined the EU in the early 2000s. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the year-on-year fall to 881,000 in the number of these workers in the period of July to September was the largest since 1997. The annual 132,000 drop in the number of workers from the EU as a whole was also unprecedented. Employment from the rest of the world grew by 34,000. The decline came as the latest ONS statistics showed tentative signs of easing in demand for labour but a marked increase in earnings growth. While the number of people employed grew by 23,000 between June and September, the number of jobless people rose by 21,000 to 1.38 million. The unemployment rate edged up from 4% to 4.1%. With unemployment still close to levels last seen in the mid-1970s, the recent upward pressure on wages continued. The ONS said total pay, which includes bonuses, was growing at an annual rate of 3% in the three months ending in September – the fastest growth rate in three years. Adjusted for inflation, earnings were up by 0.9%, a rate not exceeded since late 2016. Annual growth in regular pay, which strips out bonuses, reached 3.2%, a rate not seen since the immediate aftermath of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, which pushed the global economy into its deepest recession since the second world war.
