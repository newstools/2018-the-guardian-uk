José Mourinho fears Alexis Sánchez could be out until the New Year with the hamstring he suffered in training. “We haven’t had any scans yet, but my initial feeling is that it is worse than the injury to Victor Lindelof,” the Manchester United manager said. “I don’t think it is a small thing that will keep him out for a week or 10 days, it is likely to be a few weeks longer than that. You can tell sometimes when you see these things. Judging by the painful scream it is not a small thing, it is what I call an aggressive type of injury.” A fit Sánchez sat out United’s last game, when a late winner from Marouane Fellaini brought the victory over Young Boys that ensured the club’s qualification for the knockout stage of the Champions League. Mourinho believes the ungainly midfielder is belatedly getting the credit he deserves for his flexibility and all round game. “I think everyone can see what he does now,” the manager said. “He’s not Maradona but it is clear to see what he is and what he can do. As well as scoring can score important goals in important moments I know the positions he can play and the jobs he can do. I have used him as an extra central defender and then I have sent him forward as a striker. He’s very adaptable, he can be important in both boxes.”
