Anthony Mundine’s ring walk proved longer than his final fight as Jeff Horn launched a blistering early attack to knock out the 43-year-old and settle the showdown at Suncorp Stadium in just one minute 36 seconds.

Mundine congratulated Horn afterwards before confirming he would not take to the ring again as a professional boxer. “I was ready, I was prepared,” Mundine said. “It’s just boxing, you just get caught sometimes.” More to follow.
