Wales cannot understand why the Australia centre Samu Kerevi escaped punishment for a late tackle on Leigh Halfpenny last weekend that left the full-back concussed. Halfpenny, who suffered his fourth concussion in as many years, was injured six minutes from the end of Wales’s victory when Kerevi attempted a charge down and clattered into the full-back’s head with his left shoulder. The referee Ben O’Keeffe did not consult the television match official. He ruled that the contact was unavoidable and accidental, a conclusion shared by the citing officer who took no action even though Halfpenny failed a head injury assessment and has to follow protocols to return. “It was unbelievable it was not a penalty,” said the Wales skills coach, Neil Jenkins. “Leigh does not go down lightly, a tough old player. For him to have to undergo an HIA shows there was some sort of head contact. “The referee on the day did not think so and it is what it is. We have to get on with it. Leigh will go through his protocols and we will see where he is at later on in the week.” Wales face Tonga at the Principality Stadium on Saturday, a match Halfpenny is unlikely to feature in even if fit. Wales have delayed their team announcement by 48 hours until Thursday with the wing George North and the prop Tomas Francis facing fitness tests. The prop Samson Lee has been released from the squad after failing to recover from a hamstring injury but the fly-half Rhys Patchell, who was not considered for the matches against Scotland and Australia as he recovered from concussion, is in contention this weekend. “Rhys was outstanding for us in the summer and it is excellent to have him available again,” said Jenkins. “We have a fantastic squad: the boys were outstanding on Saturday and I am sure a few will have an opportunity this weekend.”
