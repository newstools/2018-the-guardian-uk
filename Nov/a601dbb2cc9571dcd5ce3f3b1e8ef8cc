Former Wales rugby union international Gareth Thomas has said he was the victim of a homophobic attack in Cardiff in an emotional video on social media. Thomas, who retired in 2011 after a brief spell in rugby league, came out as gay in 2009 and has since become a campaigner for equal rights but appeared to have suffered facial bruising from the attack, which he claimed took place on Saturday night in the Welsh capital. “This morning I have decided to make what I hope will be a positive video,” he said on Twitter. “Last night I was the victim in my home city of a hate crime for my sexuality. Why I want it to be positive: I want to say thankyou to the police, who were involved and allowed me to do restorative justice to the people that did this because I thought they could learn more that way. And also to the people of Cardiff who supported me and helped me because there’s a lot of people out there who want to hurt us. But, unfortunately for them, there’s a lot more who want to help us heal. So this, I hope, will be a positive message.” pic.twitter.com/TUSyVMLiWX More to follow...
