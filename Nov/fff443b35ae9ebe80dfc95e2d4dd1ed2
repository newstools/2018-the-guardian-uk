Knickers the very large Holstein Friesian cow has taken the world by storm after a photo of the steer standing among smaller cattle went viral. Knickers’ fame prompted a “fact check” from the Washington Post and an associated tweet in which they declared “the big cow is a lie”. The big cow is a lie. https://t.co/CMkhUGw1nY However, fans of Knickers can rest easy – I’m here to tell you that the cow is actually quite large. First, let’s get the nomenclature out of the way. The Washington Post headline declares: “Meet Knickers, the giant cow that is neither a cow nor a giant,” taking issue with people referring to a male steer as a cow. Like it or not, referring to bovines of all sexes as “cow” is widely accepted, and this usage is cited in multiple dictionaries. And now on to the size. Comparing Knickers to other animals shows that he is, indeed, a very large lad: Knickers is a mere 8.7cm shorter than the world record holding steer, Bellino, and is 4cm taller than the tallest (female) cow, Blosom. According to Cattle Network, Holstein Friesian males are typically 170-180cm in height. Needless to say, Knickers’ 194cm is quite a bit above the top of this range. So, Knickers is indeed a very big cow. Which, strangely, even the Washington Post admits in the article text itself. DON'T YOU MILKSHAKE DUCK KNICKERS YOU MONSTERS
