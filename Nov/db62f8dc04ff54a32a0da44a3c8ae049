Theresa May’s formidable resilience in the face of her Tory colleagues’ plots and jibes has long been the source of grudging admiration among even her fiercest critics. But this week’s political endurance test was extraordinary by any standards. Within the space of little more than 48 hours, she sat through a fractious five-hour cabinet meeting at which Brexit-backing ministers queued up to have their gripes recorded for posterity, as well as suffering two cabinet resignations and facing three hours of hostile questioning, much of it from her own side, in the Commons. She had barely sat down when double-breasted renegade Jacob Rees-Mogg addressed a scrum of lobby journalists to signal his intention of trying to trigger a leadership challenge against her. Yet later that afternoon, there she was, behind a podium in the wood-panelled room upstairs in No 10 Downing Street, comparing herself to her dull-but-reliable cricketing hero, Geoffrey Boycott, who “stuck to it and got the runs in the end”. “Having worked with her, she’s one of those people who perform best in adversity,” says Chris Wilkins, who was director of strategy during May’s first 12 months in Downing Street. “I think she also feels at the moment that she’s come so far with this, and she’s been through everything she’s been through, and it’s made her all the more determined to see it through.” That was certainly May’s mood at her press conference as she sought to address the British public over the heads of her squabbling MPs. “My approach throughout has been to put the national interest first. Not a partisan interest. And certainly not my own political interest,” she said. Unlike some of my party colleagues, she might have added. Moderate Tories who have long believed the hardline Brexiters will stop at nothing until they get the drastic break with Brussels they have spent a political lifetime campaigning for reacted with fury to the latest mutiny. Anna Soubry, the former business minister who has become the champion of Tory remainers, said: “It is absolutely outrageous. I can’t tell you how appalled and angry I am.” Veteran MP Nicholas Soames described the activities of Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group (ERG) colleagues, many of whom published strongly worded letters of no confidence in the prime minister, as a “vulgar and pathetic display of inferior virtue signalling”. By Friday morning, Rory Stewart, the prisons minister who dented his cerebral reputation when he had to apologise for making up a statistic (“80% of the British public support this deal”), had resorted to retweeting the Dalai Lama. That one 👇 https://t.co/qv9Fu0HWK1 It was one of those who’s-up-who’s-down weeks that make The Thick of It look like a documentary – and that political nerds find irresistibly compelling. But this particular episode of the Westminster soap opera will have a profound bearing on Britain’s future. Whether May survives the next few weeks – and who succeeds her if she falls – will determine whether, and how, Brexit goes ahead. “The two are inextricably linked,” said Anand Menon, of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank. “The person who is prime minister will play a decisive role in shaping the nature of Brexit.” If May does face a vote of no confidence, and is toppled by the hard Brexiters, it is unclear who would replace her. The ERG’s slick tactician Steve Baker, who spent Friday all over the airwaves trying to encourage those who might be considering writing letters to trigger a vote of no confidence, suggested they could even draw lots to decide which leaver ran. Forty-eight Conservative MPs would need to back a no-confidence vote in Theresa May to trigger a leadership contest, according to party rules. There are two ways a contest can be triggered, most obviously if the leader of the party resigns. If they do not, 15% of Conservative MPs must write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories. With the party’s current crop of 317 MPs, 48 would be needed. After David Cameron announced his resignation, five Tory MPs stood for the leadership. Unlike Labour party rules, under which candidates go to a ballot of members as long as they have the support of 15% of the party’s MPs, Conservative candidates are whittled down to a final two before party members have their say. The ballot is based on “one member, one vote”, but in 2016 one of the final two candidates, Andrea Leadsom, withdrew from the race after a damaging interview with the Times about the fact that May did not have children. Her withdrawal meant May was made party leader without having been elected by members. A new leader would surely mean a bid to reopen the negotiations and find a deal that could be sellable to parliament – with just months left before the 29 March deadline when Britain is due to leave the European Union. And even without a change of PM, Brexit-backing cabinet ministers are already plotting to pile the pressure on her to go back to Brussels and seek to rewrite the text of the backstop, the most contentious part of the withdrawal agreement. Michael Gove’s decision to remain in the government – revealed on Friday morning after a night of speculation as he agonised over his future – does not mean he has agreed to knuckle under and back the deal but quite the reverse. Instead, he plans to ally with Andrea Leadsom and other leavers to force changes to a deal he believes is “not a runner” as it stands. But if May does win a confidence vote, and is given breathing space to bring her deal back to parliament, some in Westminster believe it is not quite as “dead in the water” as the Conservative MP Mark Francois told her it was on Thursday. Since her conference speech in Birmingham last month, May has begun to make the argument to her colleagues that one of the risks of voting against her deal, with all the criticisms levelled against it, is “no Brexit”. Her opponents from across the spectrum – hard Brexit to ardent remain – are pinning their hopes on the idea the deal will be rejected by parliament, allowing MPs to somehow seize back control of the process and force the prime minister to change course. But May’s allies in government are counting on the fact that if it comes to that point, the leavers do not have the numbers to secure a majority of MPs for a looser relationship with Brussels. “As crazy as it sounds after a week like this, I still think Brexiteers are tactically in a difficult place,” one government source said. “I still think it is either the deal on the table or even softer versions of Brexit. The only option if they want Brexit is to end up voting for the deal.” And ironically, the more support garnered by the slick People’s Vote campaign – which has growing backing in parliament, and a string of high-profile converts, most recently Gary Lineker – the more plausible May’s warning to Brexiters becomes. Next weekend’s EU summit, if May is permitted by her party to get that far, should see leaders from the 27 other member states sign up to the painstakingly negotiated deal, pat May on the back and stress that it is their final offer. Then, with the Brexiters’ highfalutin warnings about vassalage starting to sound rather tired, the real selling job can begin. Brexit-watchers have been frantically trying to tally up the numbers in the House of Commons ever since the 585-page doorstop was published on Wednesday evening. But with the vote in parliament not expected to be held until 10 December or thereabouts, Tory whips believe all but the most hardline backers of Brexit or a second referendum may potentially still be in play. A week is a painfully long time in politics in these febrile times – a cliche hard to avoid this week – and the prime minister could be toppled within days. But her allies believe if anyone has the qualities to drag Brexit over the line, it is Theresa May. “I sometimes wonder what it is that makes her get up in the morning and face the disobliging headlines and cartoons,” said her de facto deputy, David Lidington, on Friday. “What it is is a very old-fashioned sense of public service.” And her former aide Wilkins says: “I suspect there will be a confidence vote next week; and she’s not bluffing when she says even if she wins it by one vote, she’ll stay on. And I think she will win it by significantly more than that.”
