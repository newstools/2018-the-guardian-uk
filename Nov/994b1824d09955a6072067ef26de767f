Saving sex for marriage sounds so ridiculously old-fashioned that sometimes even I can hardly believe I’m doing it. My parents aren’t Christian and I don’t have a purity ring. I’m also not waiting because I believe that sex would make me dirty, impure or less-loved by God. This is a decision I made at 18, because I believe that sex outside marriage is a sin. I believe that marriage is what God has given us so that we can experience a glimpse of the love between Christ and his followers. Ultimately, when I sin, it’s an act of separation from God. In my life, the periods where I’m close to God are the times when I flourish and feel a profound sense of peace. That’s not to say I haven’t been tempted. I’m not a saint, just a normal uni student who has definitely had a few drunken kisses on nights out. I’ve also had my head banged against a wall by a guy I was kissing because I didn’t want to go any further, and once had to keep removing the hands of a guy from going down my jeans. I don’t want to engage fully in a culture that treats sex so casually, and has resulted in some people feeling entitled to it. I’ve read all the feminist critiques of the church’s teachings on sex. I know if I eventually have sex it will probably be painful, and friends’ comments about sexual incompatibility and “trying before you buy” worry me. I also acknowledge there’s a chance I’ll never get married. But my faith in Jesus gives me such a sense of joy and purpose, and I believe it should have implications for how I live my life. That includes my sex life. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours? Email sex@theguardian.com
