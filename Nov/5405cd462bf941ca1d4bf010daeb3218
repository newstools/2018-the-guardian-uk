We’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers. In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story. In the coming weeks and months, we could be hearing from you and the person you share your home with. If you have an interesting or remarkable co-living arrangement, tell us about your situation in the form below and one of our journalists may be in touch about featuring your story. Give us as much detail as you can, as well as contact details for an account or number you check regularly. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
