Q: Which books can help my 10-year-old daughter navigate her feelings of low self-esteem and not fitting in at school?Joanne Phillips, 48, writer, indexer and single mum Fiona Noble, children’s book reviewer for the Observer, writes:On the cusp of secondary school and puberty, 10 can be a challenging time, and books offer children a safe place to explore these emotions. In the award-winning Roller Girl by Victoria Jamieson, 12-year-old Astrid faces the toughest summer of her life when she and her best friend begin to drift apart. Signing up for roller derby camp is a gamechanger. This sparky, inspirational graphic novel is full of wisdom and heart, capturing the complexities of growing up, self-discovery and coping with change. The setting may be American, but themes of empowerment and perseverance will have universal resonance. Cath Howe’s background as a primary schoolteacher brings insight and authentic characters to her well-observed debut, Ella on the Outside. Ella has moved to a new town and is thrilled when school queen bee Lydia befriends her. But Lydia, it seems, has an ulterior motive and Ella becomes tangled in a web of secrets, lies and peer pressure. Howe poignantly chronicles Ella’s struggle with anxiety and self-esteem and is excellent on friendship dynamics and making the right choices. Finally, children’s nonfiction is full of books designed to inspire and empower, from Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls to Fantastically Great Women Who Changed the World. You Are Awesome by Matthew Syed, meanwhile, examines people, from Mozart to Serena Williams, who achieved their potential through hard work and resilience. A practical, motivational approach to building confidence. Submit your question for Book Clinic below or email bookclinic@observer.co.uk
