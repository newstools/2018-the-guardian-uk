Conmebol has confirmed that the postponed second leg of the Copa Libertadores final between River Plate and Boca Juniors will be played at the Bernabéu stadium, more than 6,000 miles away from the original venue, on 9 December. Fans of both sides will be given an equal allocation of tickets. Argentina’s two biggest teams drew the first leg 2-2 at Boca’s ground and were due to play the second match in South America’s equivalent of the Champions League final at River’s El Monumental stadium on Saturday. However, three Boca players, including the former Manchester City and Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez, were left needing medical attention when River fans attacked Boca’s bus as it approached the stadium and the game was delayed until Sunday and then postponed indefinitely. Thursday’s decision to play the second leg in Madrid came after Conmebol’s meeting in Asunción on Tuesday. The South American confederation also confirmed that River will be fined $400,000 (£310,000) and have their ground closed for two games. “Those of us who know the beautiful game, know that it is only about winning or losing – not killing or dying for,” said the Conmebol president, Alejandro Domínguez. “I would like to begin by thanking Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, [the Fifa president Gianni] Infantino, [the Uefa president Aleksander] Ceferin and my good friend [Real Madrid president] Florentino Pérez. “The administration has elected to hold the Copa Libertadores final return leg, in front of both sets of supporters in Madrid, at the Santiago Bernabéu on 9 December at 8.30pm local time [7.30pm GMT]”. Real Madrid are due to play an away match in La Liga at Huesca that day. Sánchez tweeted: “Spain is ready to organise the final of the Copa Libertadores between Boca Juniors and River Plate. “The security forces have extensive experience of these situations and are already working on the necessary deployments to ensure the event is secure.”
