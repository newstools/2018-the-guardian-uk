Dez Bryant is back in the NFL and with a Super Bowl contender after agreeing to a one-year contract with the New Orleans Saints. Both the Associated Press and ESPN confirmed the move on Wednesday citing league sources who requested anonymity. The mercurial yet prolific wide receiver, who turned 30 on Sunday, had been on the open market since April, when he was released after an eight-season stint with the Dallas Cowboys. The 6ft 2in, 220lbs receiver recorded three straight seasons of at least 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns from 2012 to 2014, but his production was marred at times by public confrontations with coaches and teammates during games and practices. After the three-time Pro Bowler’s production dipped last season – 69 receptions for 838 yards and six touchdowns – Bryant was released by the Cowboys with two years remaining on a five-year, $70m contract. Now Bryant has re-emerged with one of the NFL’s best offenses and hottest teams. The Saints have won seven straight since opening the season with a loss and rank second in the NFL in scoring despite a dearth of talent at the wide receiver position due to a series of injuries.
