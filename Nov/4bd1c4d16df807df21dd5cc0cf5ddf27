Trim 750g of fennel, then slice into pieces no thicker than a pencil. The thicker you slice them, the longer they will take to cook. Warm a thin layer of olive oil in a frying pan then add the fennel, a few pieces at a time if there isn’t room for them all at once, and let them cook until pale gold. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Remove from the heat and pour over 250ml of double cream. Tear up 45g of fresh white bread and place in the bowl of a food processor. Add 10g of parsley leaves, the grated zest of an orange, a little salt and black pepper, and 25g of pine kernels. Process briefly to give a rough-textured crumb mixture. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the cream is bubbling around the edges Scatter the seasoned breadcrumb mixture over the surface of the cream. Trickle a little olive oil over the crumbs. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the cream is bubbling around the edges. Fennel tends to become bitter when browned too enthusiastically, so take care to let it colour only lightly, with just the edges turning pale gold, before adding the cream. Celeriac likes this treatment, too, as does kholrabi and celery. Keep the slices quite thin. Add rosemary to the crumbs or chopped dill (in the case of kohlrabi). I like these both as a principal dish or an accompaniment, but they are equally good simply spooned over thick toast. The fennel is a fine dressing for slices of toasted polenta.
