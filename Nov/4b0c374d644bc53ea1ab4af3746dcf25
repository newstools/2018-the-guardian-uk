I have been in a new job for about three months, but I’ve received interview offers for higher-paying jobs in an allied industry. Is it OK to leave? First, I’ll answer as a friend: money is not the only reason you work. Hopefully, you chose your current role for all sorts of factors: job satisfaction, location, career advancement, perks, to learn, to teach, to meet good people. Whatever the reason, it’s worth thinking about your personal criteria and measuring the two roles against that list, not just the money. It happens all too often that people use that golden salary figure as the be-all and end-all decider, when more intangible traits such as feeling valued have a longer-lasting effect on your happiness at work. Now I’ll answer as a boss: do you know how difficult and costly it is to recruit? The advertising costs, time spent sorting through CVs, the interviews, hiring, dealing with recruiters who send you endless texts and emails? Even when we find a new hire who fits the bill, the first few months, during which they are settling in and not operating at maximum efficiency, can be costly, too. Talent acquisition is my number one challenge, and it feels as if it will be an eternal problem. If you feel that your current job isn’t right for you, then do the honourable thing by bowing out and letting your manager start the whole process again with someone who is genuinely committed. When you were hired, the company decided to make an investment in you. Your colleagues make an investment in you, too – in getting to know and support you. It’s always OK to leave, if that’s how you feel. But a word of advice? Be a bit more discerning about your career choices: don’t waste other people’s time. • Send your questions for Sharmadean to bossing.it@theguardian.com Looking for a job?
