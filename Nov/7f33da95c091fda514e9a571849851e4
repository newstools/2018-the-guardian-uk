Jude Law has defended A Rainy Day in New York, the film he made with Woody Allen in 2017 and which has been indefinitely shelved after a number of its stars publicly disassociated themselves from Allen over sex assault allegations made by the director’s daughter, Dylan Farrow. A Rainy Day in New York was shot in September and October 2017, with a cast including Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez and Rebecca Hall. However, shortly after its completion a string of actors, including Chalamet and Hall, announced they regretted having worked on the film, and made donations to charity. Speaking to the New York Times, Law described the film’s shelving as “a terrible shame”. “I’d love to see it. People worked really hard and put a lot in, obviously himself included [referring to the director].” The film’s producer, Amazon Studios, which signed a five-movie contract with Allen in 2016, announced in August that “no date has been set” for the film’s release, and it is thought it may lose up to $25m (£19m) if the film does not come out. Amazon was responding to mounting disquiet from #MeToo and Time’s Up campaigners after Farrow repeated her allegation of sex assault against her father in an LA Times editorial in December 2017, and a TV interview in January 2018. Woody Allen has denied the allegations made by Farrow. When asked if he considered joining Chalamet and Hall in attacking Allen, Law said: “I didn’t really want to get involved, to be honest. I just don’t feel like it was my place to comment, and it’s too delicate a situation. I feel like enough has been said about it. It’s a private affair.” Actors remain divided as to whether they would work with Allen again. Colin Firth, Mira Sorvino and Greta Gerwig are among those who say they won’t, while Javier Bardem said: “If he called me … I’d be there tomorrow morning.” Law was more equivocal, saying: “I don’t know. I’d have to consider carefully.”
