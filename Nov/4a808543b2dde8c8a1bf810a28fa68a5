Nicolas Roeg messed me up. That is why I loved him. He messed everything up in ways that are still shocking, exciting and maybe even, as the kids say, “problematic”. Raping an unconscious woman? It’s there in Bad Timing, largely shunned on release as “sick”, although I think this take on obsession is his masterpiece. Gender-blurring, transmogrification, characters merging? He did it all in Performance. Everything is warped in a Roeg film except that gaze, sometimes voyeuristic, so he makes us, the audience, complicit, as time itself swirls back and forth. This is a shaman at work. Everyone declares Don’t Look Now his best work, but how to choose? I rewatched The Man Who Fell to Earth not long ago and I had forgotten the amount of sex in it. Lots of sex. Roeg showed sex more directly, but also more perversely than just about any other director. He queers the pitch in Performance, while in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Candy Clark carries a fragile, limp David Bowie to her room in a scene that still seems new. This is a film about alienation and alcoholism as much as it is about being an alien. Newton (Bowie) is numbing himself. His behaviour on set was said to be similarly disconnected. Then, when Gary Oldman shows up in Roeg’s film Track 29, looking for his long-lost mother, everything goes off the rails and is smashed. We may explain this away as non-linear narrative, but there is something else, too. Roeg takes us into other worlds via fragmenting this one. Whatever you think you know, you don’t. When Anjelica Huston rips her face off in one of his more commercial efforts (The Witches), the audience gasps. But there are such moments in each of his films that send us spinning: Jenny Agutter’s hand on black skin, Art Garfunkel’s penknife, Mick Jagger’s slicked-back hair, Bowie removing his contact lenses. Whatever the source was, Roeg tapped it, drank deep and showed us shards of it that will never leave our memory.
