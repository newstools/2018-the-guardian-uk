Brent Weinbach. I saw him in Los Angeles at the Upright Citizens Brigade in 2010 when I was doing a summer internship. He’s so absurd and fearless. I remember a bit where he was giving audience members the most bizarre/best lap dance I have seen and it sent me into tears. I only read depressing books about murderers and other kinds of deranged criminals … so, I guess the funniest out of those would be Gone Girl. Phil Burgers AKA Dr Brown. Summer Heights High. I love how Chris Lilley completely loses himself in each of his characters, especially Ja’mie King, the spoilt teenage girl. The joke is never that he is a man playing a girl, which I think is a really hard thing to achieve. I’ve had two perms. I regret neither. I think big fuzzy hair is gr8. When I was very young, I had a recurring dream where the Wicked Witch of the West would turn my dad’s eyebrows green and he couldn’t wash it out. Scarred me for life. The concept of hell. BananaPants, an original compound word. Natalie Palamides: Nate is at Soho Theatre, W1, Tuesday 13 November to 1 December
