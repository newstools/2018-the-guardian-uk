With so much time spent on tablets, phones and computers, our neck muscles are under pressure. Here are two simple moves that will bring some relief. If you are unsure whether yoga is right for you, consult your GP. 1 RagdollThis pose is great for full-body relaxation. Stand up with your legs hip-width apart. Bend your knees slightly, hold your elbows with your hands, then fold over at the hips and hang forward with your head down, letting the whole body release. Your stomach should touch your thighs. While holding this pose, move your body gently in small circles. Try some tiny forward and back motions. Keep breathing and let your whole body relax. 2 Shoulder detoxYou need a non-stretchy yoga strap for this. While sitting up on your knees, or standing with legs hip-width apart, take the strap and grab it with your arms about a metre apart, palms facing down, thumbs on the inside. Hold it out in front of you, parallel to the floor. Inhale and raise your arms up and take the strap over your head and back behind you. If this is too easy, close the grip on the strap so that your hands are closer together; if too hard, open up your grip. Inhale again and bring your arms back up, over your head and in front of you. Repeat for a total of 10 half-circles, inhaling as you begin each move. â€¢ Michele Pernetta is a teacher at Fierce Grace, London fiercegrace.com
