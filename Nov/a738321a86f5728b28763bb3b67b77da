The Matildas are back. After falling to a shock defeat in Penrith on Saturday, a degree of order was restored on a wild night in Newcastle where four goals in 17 breathless minutes accounted for Chile at the second time of asking and ensured Alen Stajcic’s side end the year on a winning note. A goalless, if entertaining, first half at McDonald Jones Stadium gave way to a brief but game-defining period of carnage sparked by Caitlin Foord in the 52nd minute as the Matildas wreaked havoc in the Chilean defence to gain some revenge for the weekend’s 3-2 reverse in western Sydney. Foord laid on the first for Sam Kerr before scoring two of her own in quick succession. Emily Gielnik rounded off the blitz and effectively sealed the result by making it 4-0 on 69 minutes and Foord found the back of the net for a third time with two minutes remaining – the first hat-trick of her international career.
