This is one of a handful of soups my mother has been making for years. I didn’t put it into my first cookbook, a collection of family recipes, because it didn’t feel very ‘Indian’, but families and their collections of recipes are messy, eclectic and wonderful things forged over many years and many experiences. This is the recipe that almost got away. When writing it down, I asked Mum how much ginger to add. She said: ‘According to the weather,’ so the quantity given here is for a cold November’s day. By all means kick it up a notch for extra warmth. Mum and I make this soup in slightly different ways. She likes to boil the beetroot first, but I prefer to grate it into the pan, which shortens the overall cooking time – both methods work. This soup goes well with a sharp, non-dairy yoghurt (or add a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt to sharpen the yoghurt). Prep 12 minCook 45 minServes 4 3 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 large white onion, peeled and chopped2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1 green finger chilli, finely chopped 500g beetroot, scrubbed and grated (or chopped small)1 small potato (about 100g) , peeled and grated 750ml vegetable stock Salt, to taste To serveSourdough, non-dairy yoghurt and nigella seeds Heat the oil in a large pot and, once it’s good and hot, add the onion and fry, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli, then fry, stirring all the while, for three minutes. Add the beetroot and potato, stir to coat, then pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and leave to simmer for 30 minutes. Leave the soup to cool a little, then blend and taste for salt – I needed to add a quarter-teaspoon. Transfer the soup into bowls and top with a spoonful of yoghurt and a sprinkling of nigella seeds. Serve hot with the grilled sourdough alongside.
