Just two classical games to go, and the Magnus Carlsen v Fabiano Caruana world championship match seems inexorably headed towards speed tie-breaks next Wednesday. They are level at 5-5 in the €1m series at The College in Holborn, London after drawing the first 10 games, a deadlock record unequalled since official world championships began in 1886. Both have had fleeting chances. The biggest fish which got away was in game eight, where Caruana’s opening novelty against the sharp Sveshnikov Sicilian gave him a dominating position where he missed 23 Rae1! Next turn there was still 24 Qh5! instead of the wimpish 24 h3? That would have been not just a win, but a classic to rank alongside Max Euwe’s Pearl of Zandvoort against Alexander Alekhine and Bobby Fischer’s sixth game against Boris Spassky. What exactly happens if they reach 6-6? The tie-break format is two rapid games at 25 minutes each plus 10 seconds per move increment, then (if they are still level) two blitz games with five minutes each plus three seconds per move. If this finishes 1-1, then there are further two-game blitz mini-matches up to a maximum of 10 blitz games. Only if they are still level after 12 classical and 12 rapid/blitz games does the fearfully-named Armageddon arrive. White has five minutes, Black four minutes, with a three-second per move increment starting at move 61. An Armageddon draw counts as a win for Black. In theory Carlsen or Caruana could win the match by drawing every classical, rapid and blitz game, then drawing with Black in Armageddon, but from where we are now this is still a very remote long odds against chance. If it comes to tie-breaks, Carlsen has much higher rapid and blitz ratings than his opponent and has never lost a play-off. In one of the post-game press conferences, Caruana disputed that he is the speed underdog, but it is hard to forget his catastrophic 25 defeats at the Grand Tour rapid/blitz in Paris and Brussels this summer or how he was crushed 20.5-6.5 by Levon Aronian in the chess.com speed knockout. So although Carlsen will surely make a serious winning attempt with his final White in Saturday’s game 11, there is also an argument for Plan B, namely to eschew all risk at the end as he did against Sergey Karjakin in 2016 and head for the tie-breaks. When the match does finally end, the winner will receive the plaudits, the traditional laurel wreath from the new Fide president Arkady Dvorkovich, prize money of €600,000 or €550,000 (depending on whether it goes to tie-breaks) ,and a guaranteed minimum two-year reign until the next challenger arrives in 2020. But what about the loser? For Caruana, it will not be so bad. Having got extremely close and proving himself Carlsen’s equal at match play, he has every incentive to aim for another title shot in 2020 when he will be only 28 years old. His 2832 rating is virtually equal to Carlsen’s 2835, he can realistically plan to capture the No 1 global rating soon. Carlsen has been top dog in the ratings for seven years and has said that he values No 1 almost as much as the official crown. Caruana will also have plenty to look forward to in his home city of St Louis and for the US team, which will aim to capture the world team championship and regain the Olympiad gold medals from China in 2020. America’s billionaire benefactor Rex Sinquefield, who has made St Louis a global capital for international chess, is always looking for new ideas. Would Carlsen and Fide agree to a Carlsen v Caruana rematch in St Louis in 2019? Giving the champion the right to accept a challenge from the No 1 in the rankings is at least an arguable concept. It will be much more traumatic if Carlsen loses his crown. While the US has other elite grandmasters and rising talents, Norway’s chess boom is based on Carlsen, whose laconic down to earth personality has made him a national hero. When NRK, the government-owned broadcaster, made the bold decision in 2913 to televise live the whole of Carlsen’s first match against Vishy Anand, critics said that it would be like watching paint to dry. But for the final game in Chennai the TV audience was 355,000. In 2014 for the return series in Sochi, 572,000 watched the decisive game. In 2016, when Carlsen and Karjakin played their speed tiw-breaks in New York, 768,000, 56% of the national TY audience, saw the programme. NRK makes it a spectator sport. The live show has audience participation, a meter to show thecomputer odds and a light approach, plus a resident grandmaster. In the last resort it works because Carlsen wins the matches at the end. But if he loses, and has no further chance for at least two years, the chess boom will probably falter, as it did in Britain and the US in the 1970s when Fischer refused to meet Anatoly Karpov. Carlsen would have to cope with his own form crisis. Asked to name their chess hero, Caruana answered “Fischer” while Carlsen replied “myself, four or five years ago”. Some of his sharpness and accuracy has diminished and he has become like Mikhail Botvinnik after the 1040s, primus inter pares rather than supremely dominant. He might struggle to win the 2020 candidates ahead of the Azeri world No 3 Shak Mamedyarov and China’s’s No 4 Ding Liren. Much is at stake. Game 11 on Saturday, game 12 on Monday, and tie-breaks if needed on Wednesday are the dates for your diary. The world women’s championship, a 64-player knock-out, went to a final tie-break on Friday, China’s Ju Wenjun, who kept her crown with a 5-3 score against Russia’s Katervna Lagno, is ranked No 2 behind Hou Yifan, who is working for a masters degree from a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford. Fide is changing the format of the women’s event, so that Ju will keep her title until 2020 and then meet the winner of an eight-player candidates. Ju, needing to win the fourth classical game with Black, surprised her opponent with 5...e5!? which she followed up with f7-f6, rooks on the g file, and an attack on the white king. Black fluffed her first opportunity (19...c4! 20 Nxg6 Bxd6 21 dxc4 Be6 and the attack will break through) but received a second chance by 28 Kh1?? when 28 Qh5! is level Ju aeized on the mistake by rerouting her bishop to the long white diagonal by 28...Bc8! which led to a speedy mating attack. 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 g6 4 O-O Bg7 5 Re1 e5!? 6 a3 Nge7 7 Nc3 O-O 8 Bc4 d6 9 d3 h6 10 Nd5 Kh7 11 c3 f5 12 exf5 gxf5 13 b4 Ng6 14 b5 Na5 15 Ba2 Be6 16 Qa4 b6 17 Bd2 Rg8 18 Rad1 Qd7 19 Nh4?
