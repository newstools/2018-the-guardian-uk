The Cleveland Cavaliers are trying to identify a fan who racially taunted San Antonio guard Patty Mills. Mills, who is Australian and of Torres Islander and Aboriginal heritage, was at the foul line in the fourth quarter on Sunday when a male spectator can be heard on the ABC broadcast twice yelling, “Hey, Jamaica called, they want their bobsledder back!” @KingJames am I the only one who heard this guy in the crowd yell “hey Jamaican dog they want their bobsledder back! Hey @Patty_Mills Jamaica just called, they want their bobsledder back!” 😳😠🙅🏾‍♀️ #SundayFunday ??? @NBA pic.twitter.com/RvHdu88Gzd Mills posted a message on Twitter thanking a fan who tweeted a clip of the taunts. Mills wrote: “I am a proud Islander. Like my Jamaican Brothers, me & my family in the islands of the Torres Strait have experienced racial slurs for decades. Hope your efforts will enlighten this confused, hateful fan.” Thanks @thats_Z_Truth. I am a proud Islander. Like my Jamaican Brothers, me & my family in the islands of the Torres Strait have experienced racial slurs for decades. Hope your efforts will enlighten this confused, hateful fan. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/yH3nKlGv4A The Cavaliers said Monday the team is reviewing the matter. The team’s security department might use video footage to help spot the offender. Mills was not asked about what happened following the Spurs’ 110-94 win. It’s not yet known if Mills heard the taunts or was informed of them following the game. Last week, the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks banned four fans from attending their games after they were ejected for making racist taunts toward Washington Capitals forward Devante Smith-Pelly. Smith-Pelly, who is black, was sitting in the penalty box when the fans repeatedly chanted “basketball” at him.
