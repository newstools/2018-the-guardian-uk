Bernie Sanders’ son says he is running for Congress in New Hampshire. Levi Sanders is joining seven other Democrats and three Republicans in the race for the 1st congressional district. Democratic representative Carol Shea-Porter is stepping down after her term ends. The 48-year-old Sanders has lived in New Hampshire for 15 years, in Claremont in the 2nd congressional district. The US constitution requires only that US House members reside in the state they serve, not necessarily in the same district. The son of the Independent Vermont senator and 2016 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination proposes a “Medicare for all healthcare system”; tuition-free public college; a higher minimum wage; and “sensible gun legislation”. He is a legal services analyst in Massachusetts. His step-sister, Carina Driscoll, is running for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, a post once held by Bernie Sanders.
