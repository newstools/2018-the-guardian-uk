A member of the House intelligence committee said “We got Bannoned” on Tuesday, after a closed-door interview with Hope Hicks, a key aide to Donald Trump, as part of the panel’s Russia investigation. Bloomberg reported that Denny Heck, a Washington Democrat, invoked Bannon, Trump’s former campaign manager and White House strategist, who refused to answer some questions in front of the panel. The House is now considering whether to hold Bannon in contempt. A Republican, Chris Stewart of Utah, said Hicks would not answer questions about events and conversations since Trump took office. Hicks, Trump’s communications director, arrived on Capitol Hill after 10am through a rear entrance to the committee’s interview space. She did not answer shouted questions from reporters. The panel is investigating contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia, as is special counsel Robert Mueller. Hicks has been interviewed by Mueller. As one of Trump’s closest aides, she is a key eyewitness to his actions over the past several years. She was his spokeswoman during the 2016 campaign. WITCH HUNT! Trump has denied any collusion with Russians interfering in the US election. In the hours before Hicks’ arrival the president tweeted several times, quoting cable news commentators who said they had not seen evidence of collusion. One tweet encouraged investigations of his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton. A last tweet simply said “WITCH HUNT!” In the White House press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Sanders denied any collusion between Trump aides and Russia and said of Hicks’ appearance: “We are not going to comment on any individual’s specific interactions with the committee.”
