Lightly brown 2 chicken breasts in a pan in a little olive oil. Slice 150g of small, white mushrooms. Peel and slice 2 cloves of garlic. Add the mushrooms and the garlic to the chicken, with a little more oil or butter if necessary, and leave to cook, stirring and turning the chicken occasionally. Pour 1 litre of chicken stock into the pan, bring to the boil then simmer for about 20 minutes. Lift the chicken out of the pan and keep warm. Stir 1 tbsp of white miso into the broth. Add 100g of dried noodles to the pan, cook for a few minutes until tender (most skinny noodles are ready in four minutes). Dunk a handful of young kale leaves into boiling water and then into the chicken stock. Slice the chicken into thick pieces and divide between 2 large bowls. Pour over the miso broth, noodles and kale, then serve. Enough for 2. The chicken could be grilled instead of cooked on the hob. When I take that route, I slice the breast in half horizontally, so the meat cooks more quickly. This broth, with its notes of umami and soft textured noodles, is equally good made with aubergines. Slice the fruit thickly, brush it lightly with oil then place it on a hot griddle. Cook until nicely browned, turn, then cook the other side. You could use savoy cabbage leaves, tightly rolled and finely shredded, instead of kale. If I have any little dumplings in the freezer, I might pop a few in the broth as it simmers.
