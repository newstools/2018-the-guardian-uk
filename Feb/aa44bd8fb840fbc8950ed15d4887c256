Police investigating the deaths of three people in a house fire in Northern Ireland have arrested a man on suspicion of murder. The 27-year-old was detained at the scene and transferred to hospital for treatment before his arrest. Det Supt Jason Murphy of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: “At this time we believe the fire, which has claimed at least three lives, was started deliberately. “We are continuing to thoroughly examine the scene along with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland fire and rescue service.” The whitewashed rural bungalow in Derrylin, County Fermanagh, near the border with the Irish Republic, was destroyed in the blaze and the roof collapsed. The victims were members of the same family, the Democratic Unionist leader, Arlene Foster, said. The fire and rescue service (NIFRS) said its officers took an emergency call at 7.14am on Tuesday, and that the fire was “well-developed” when firefighters arrived in three vehicles from Lisnaskea and Enniskillen. The house is the only one on a rural lane off Doon Road in Derrylin, and is surrounded by farm buildings and fields. A spokeswoman for the fire service said: “The thoughts of NIFRS are with the family, friends and local community at this time.” Foster said it was devastating news for the local community and that there was widespread shock in the area. “I understand that all those who have died are members of the same family,” she said. “It is important that the cause of the fire is established but my thoughts and prayers are with all those in the local area, friends and the wider family circle as they struggle to come to terms with this terrible tragedy.” Michelle Gildernew, the Sinn Féin MP for the area, also offered her condolences. “Devastating news for the family concerned and the Derrylin community. This is absolutely tragic, God help them all,” she said.
