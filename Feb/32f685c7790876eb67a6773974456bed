Chelsea’s manager, Antonio Conte, is Italy’s top choice as national coach. “I haven’t chosen yet but I think Conte is the one who could do the best,” the Italian football association’s vice-commissioner Alessandro Costacurta told Tuesday’s Gazzetta dello Sport. “I’ll definitely talk with him in a couple of months.” Conte, whose future at Chelsea remains uncertain, coached Italy to the quarter-finals of the 2016 European Championship before joining the London club. Other coaches being considered by Costacurta include Roberto Mancini, Carlo Ancelotti, and Claudio Ranieri. “[Conte] has already shown he knows how to be national team coach while the others haven’t yet,” said Costacurta, the former Milan and Italy defender who is in charge of selecting the coach under the federation’s emergency administration. “That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t be happy with Mancini or with Ancelotti – although [Ancelotti] seems to have removed himself from consideration.” Gian Piero Ventura was fired in November after failing to qualify Italy for the World Cup. Luigi Di Biagio was promoted from the under-21 squad as an interim replacement. Italy play friendlies against Argentina and England next month and do not have a competitive match until the Nations League starts in September. Conte coached Italy from 2014-16 and announced his move to Chelsea before Euro 2016.
