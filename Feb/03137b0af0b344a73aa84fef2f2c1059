British police investigating Harvey Weinstein have received a further allegation of sexual assault. Scotland Yard received an allegation that the producer sexually assaulted a woman in Westminster in the mid 1990s, bringing the total number of women who have reported Weinstein to British police to 10. Scotland Yard has not named Weinstein but confirmed that officers from the Metropolitan police child abuse and sexual offences command had received allegations of sexual assault from 10 people under Operation Kaguyak. Police in the UK first confirmed they had opened an investigation into Weinstein in early October after Merseyside police received an allegation of sexual assault in the London area in the 1980s, and referred it to Scotland Yard. The British actor Lysette Anthony said she had told the Met she was attacked by Weinstein at her London home in the late 1980s. Officers in New York and Los Angeles have also opened investigations into allegations made against the producer. On 31 October, an alleged eighth victim told UK police she had been assaulted by Weinstein in Ireland. The allegation has been passed on to Irish police. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.
