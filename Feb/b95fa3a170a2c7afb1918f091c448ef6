Theresa May has conceded that new EU migrants who come to Britain during the Brexit transition will have the right to settle permanently in the UK, in a major climbdown over future residency rights. The concession, slipped out in a Brexit policy paper by the Home Office, also makes clear that new EU migrants who arrive after March 2019 will be given a five-year temporary residence permit, not the two-year one that was previously proposed by ministers. The policy paper does, however, make clear that new EU migrants who come to live and work in Britain after the transition period gets under way will not have the same rights after the Brexit transition to bring family to join them as EU nationals already resident in Britain who have secured “settled status”. Instead, they will have to pass a minimum income threshold test, which is currently set at £18,600 for British but not EU citizens. The three-page policy statement on new EU migrants arriving the UK during the transition period makes clear they will be given the chance to build up the five years’ continuous residency that is needed to apply to be given the right to stay permanently in Britain. It says those EU citizens and their family members who arrive during the transition period and who register will be offered “a temporary status in UK law that will enable them to stay after the implementation period has concluded – this means that they will be able to remain lawfully in the UK working, studying or being self-sufficient for the five years needed to obtain settlement”. May was accused of pandering to hard Brexiters when she promised during a three-day trip to China earlier this month to “battle the EU” over their proposal to give long-term residency rights to those who arrived after the 29 March 2019 Brexit date. The official Brexit policy document says the concessions have been made because “it is important to provide certainty to business and those EU citizens who wish to move to the UK during the implementation period as to the terms under which they will be able to remain in the UK and make a life here once the period is over”. The climbdown is likely to be sharply criticised by hard Brexiters and groups such as Migration Watch, whose claim that as many as a million EU citizens could try to take advantage of the concession has been condemned as pure speculation.
