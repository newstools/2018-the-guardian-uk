Book Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have. For example: I’m a mature student and I want to find a creative writing course. Where should I start? My son is struggling with depression. Can you recommend any first person books written by men? I’ve just read Conversation with Friends by Sally Rooney and loved it. What else can I read in the same vein? You can send us your questions by filling in the form below or by emailing us on bookclinic@observer.co.uk. We will answer one question a week and print them in the New Review.
