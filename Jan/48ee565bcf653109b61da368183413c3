The Guardian and Observer has a fresh tabloid format in print and we’re highlighting the best of your photography in the paper. Since 2014 our letters page has carried amazing images readers have shared: some of them being newsworthy, others more abstract. With our new format there will be an opportunity to showcase your images more prominently alongside the views readers have shared. From reportage to portraits, extraordinary weather events and travel photography to your best images of the places you live or the wildlife you share them with, we’re looking forward to hearing from you and seeing your work. What’s important to us is the quality of the image – the subject matter is up to you. If you have a great image you think would work on our letters page share it by completing the form below.
