School’s out for summer! And what better image to capture that moment of explosive joy on the last day of term than this chaotic and colourful image by French photographer Aurore Valade, a graduate of the elite Beaux-Arts school in Bordeaux. Valade, whose work is one of the official exhibitions at the international Rencontres d’Arles this summer, seeks to examine the idea of liberation, transgression and revolt. This 2010 picture, from the series We were bored…, features a class of 13- and 14-year-olds at a school in the Yonne region south-east of Paris. Valade, 37, says she asked the teenagers what they would secretly like to do when bored, but did not dare because it was not allowed. When most admitted they wanted to throw something, she suggested they bring in a selection of harmless projectiles, including old pens and stuffed toys. “I like to work collaboratively, so I wanted them to choose the objects they would like to throw, then got them to throw them at the same time,” says Valade. “I wanted to capture this sudden and out-of-the-ordinary burst of adolescent energy. It was about exploding, expressing and exploring something in themselves. The idea was for them to revolt; to do something unexpected, especially in a space like a school that is normally strictly controlled. “Suddenly, all is possible...including transgression and private rebellion.” More artistic than documentary, the photographs in the series – in this case a collage of three separate images – were meticulously staged. Valade says by amplifying the excessive energy of the pupils’ actions the pictures become “quasi-fictional”. This image epitomises the end-of-term euphoria many British youngsters must be feeling this weekend as the summer holidays begin. Aurore Valade: Intimate Revolts, part of the festival Les Rencontres de la Photographie, runs until 26 August at the Musée Départemental Arles Antique, France
