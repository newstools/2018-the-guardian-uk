Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he does not believe Russia is still targeting the United States, directly contradicting the nation’s top intelligence officer, who said Moscow continues to attack America’s electoral system. When asked directly by reporters whether he believed Russia was “still targeting the US”, Trump responded: “No.” His comments came less than 24 hours after Trump sought to reverse course in the wake of unrelenting, bipartisan criticism of his remarks publicly undermining US intelligence agencies. On Tuesday, Trump said that he had misspoken during a press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin and believed the conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. But moments later he again undercut his own acceptance of Russian involvement by again casting doubt on who responsible, saying that the interference “could be other people also”. Trump used the Tuesday news conference as an opportunity to defuse the brewing political crisis after the US president said that Putin privately offered an “extremely strong and powerful” denial of Russian involvement in the US election and raised concerns about the veracity of intelligence agencies’ conclusion. Trump has long sown doubt around the conclusion that Russia meddled in the presidential election and has repeatedly attacked the problem by special counsel Robert Mueller as a “witch-hunt”. Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, cautioned that Russia remains a persistent threat to US elections. “The warning lights are blinking red again,” Coats said last week. “Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.”
