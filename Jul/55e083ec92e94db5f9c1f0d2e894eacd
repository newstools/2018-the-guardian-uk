More than 30 passengers on a Ryanair flight were reportedly taken to hospital after the cabin became depressurised and the plane had to make an emergency landing in Frankfurt. A passenger on Friday’s Dublin to Croatia flight said on Facebook that the air went cold, oxygen masks dropped, and there was a “dive of 3,000 metres in less than one minute”. A lot of people complained about sore ears, but praised the pilots for doing an “excellent job”, he said. Some passengers received medical attention when the flight landed in Frankfurt. The airline said there was a shortage of accommodation for passengers who had to wait until Saturday morning for another flight. Germany’s Tagesspiegel newspaper reported that 33 passengers were taken to hospital, adding that federal police said passengers were complaining of “headache and earache and suffered from nausea”. A Ryanair spokesman said: “This flight from Dublin to Zadar diverted to Frankfurt Hahn due to an inflight depressurisation. “In line with standard procedure, the crew deployed oxygen masks and initiated a controlled descent. “The aircraft landed normally and customers disembarked, where a small number received medical attention as a precaution. “Customers were provided with refreshment vouchers and hotel accommodation was authorised, however there was a shortage of available accommodation. “Customers will board a replacement aircraft which will depart to Zadar this morning and Ryanair sincerely apologises for any inconvenience.”
