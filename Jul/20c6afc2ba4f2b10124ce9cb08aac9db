Boris Johnson’s resignation dominates Tuesday’s UK front pages, with papers bitterly divided over the former foreign secretary’s dramatic exit from cabinet, and what it means for Theresa May. The Guardian says the PM has faced down Brexit rebels “for now”, reporting May’s warning that divided cabinets lose elections. The paper says May warned hard-line Brexiters to fall into line or risk handing power to Jeremy Corbyn. The FT also reports that May is clinging to power and has vowed to fight attempts to oust her from the leadership. The Mirror gets personal as it describes Johnson’s actions as “shameless” and “scheming”, suggesting he stabbed the PM in the back as a precursor to a leadership bid of his own. The Times, Mail and the Telegraph all splash with headlines quoting Johnson’s warning that the “Brexit dream is dying”. The Times reports Johnson’s “scathing” attack on May in which he accused her of raising the white flag to Brussels and transforming Britain into a “colony” of the EU. The paper says Downing Street is braced for further resignations and that May’s fate now lies in the hands of other European leaders who are considering her new Brexit proposal. “Boris goes in for the kill” is the Daily Mail’s headline, with the paper warning the “day of chaos” has left the PM fighting for her survival. It says Johnson has declared war on May’s Brexit plan and quotes his warning that the UK is being “suffocated by self doubt”. The Telegraph also uses the headline the “Brexit dream dying”, saying the PM is preparing for a leadership challenge as more ministers are “on the brink” of resigning from cabinet. The Sun characteristically takes a different course, asking if May and Johnson could leave their infighting until after the World Cup: “Don’t you know there’s a bloody game on?” says its headline, with a photo of Johnson in an England football shirt.
