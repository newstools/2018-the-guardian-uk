At least 26 people have died after a wildfire swept through Mati, near the Greek capital Athens on Monday afternoon. The small resort town is in the Rafina region, which is popular with local tourists, particularly pensioners and children at holiday camps. The Greek government declared a state of emergency as authorities deployed firefighters and equipment from across Greece to deal with a separate blaze at Kineta, a small resort town about 35 miles (54km) west of Athens. Greek authorities urged residents to abandon their homes, with the fire closing one of the country’s busiest motorways and halting train links.
