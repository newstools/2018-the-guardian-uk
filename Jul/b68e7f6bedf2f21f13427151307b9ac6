This isn’t a debut music project from David Schwimmer, but the tongue-in-cheek moniker of British record producer Felix Clary Weatherall. Raised in Colchester, Essex, in a musical household – his father designed electronic and techno sound systems, and met Weatherall’s mother during a tour of Europe in 1990 – Weatherall was drawn to the lo-fi sounds of his father’s analogue tapes and synthesisers, and working in music seemed a natural progression. Having released a number of propulsive dancefloor singles on UK labels Magicwire and Lobster Theremin, he has now graduated to LA beat-maker Flying Lotus’s Brainfeeder labe, and his debut album, Family Portrait, arrives later this month. As its title suggests, the album is a homage to Weatherall’s parents, using a panoply of carefully selected sounds ranging from the electro synths of opener Happy Birthday Nick – referencing the early UK rave culture his parents championed – to the bouncy house of Don’t Wake Dad. Weatherall has spoken of how making the album was a process of “tapping into my emotional instability”, and the music reflects this: among the clattering drum machines, he veers into moments of quietude, such as the twinkling melodies of the title track. • Family Portrait is released on Brainfeeder on 27 July
