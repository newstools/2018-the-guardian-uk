Pep Guardiola hopes to sign Jorginho in time for the start of pre-season training on Monday, with Manchester City and Napoli close to finalising a deal for the midfielder. The 26-year-old is expected to complete the transfer in time for him to participate in the champions’ start to their preparation for next season. The initial fee will be in the region of €49m (£43m) for the Brazilian-born Italy international, who is set to agree a five-year contract. If Jorginho does join he will replace the departed Yaya Touré, who left when his contract expired last month, and challenge Fernandinho for a starting berth as the sole holding player Guardiola often operates with. The manager remains in pole position to prise Riyad Mahrez from Leicester City, though an agreement between the clubs is yet to be agreed. The basic price of the Algeria international is expected to start at £60m and with add-ons may raise to £75m. Joe Hart is due to report for training with Guardiola’s squad despite his future still remaining undecided. The 31-year-old has a year left on his contract but having spent each of the Catalan’s two seasons in charge on loan his City career is effectively over. Hart will wait to see what offers he receives before deciding where he will play next year.
