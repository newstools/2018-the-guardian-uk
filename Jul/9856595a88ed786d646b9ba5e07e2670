Andrew Griffiths, the minister for small business, has resigned from the government after being found to have sent more than 2,000 explicit messages to two women in his constituency. The Conservative MP for Burton, and Theresa May’s former chief of staff, released a statement saying apologising for what he had done, after the texts were put to him by the Sunday Mirror. In the statement, the 47-year-old junior minister said: “I am deeply ashamed at my behaviour which has caused untold distress to my wife and family, to whom I owe everything, and deep embarrassment to the prime minister and the government I am so proud to serve. “I tendered my resignation as parliamentary under secretary of state for small business on Friday night.” He added that he had referred himself to the Conservative party’s code of conduct procedures after discussions with the chief whip. “I entirely accept that pending this investigation it is right the whip is withdrawn. I wish to apologise to my constituency association and to the people of Burton I am honoured to represent.” He said he would be seeking professional help to address his unaceptable behaviour sending sex texts. “I do not seek to excuse my behaviour and will be seeking professional help to ensure it never happens again. “In time I hope to earn the forgiveness of all those who put their trust in me and that I have let down so terribly. The prime minister and the government she leads will continue to have my full support.” The Sunday Mirror has reported the content of the messages, which it described as “depraved”.
