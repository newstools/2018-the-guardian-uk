Slice open the body sack of a couple of squid to give 2 large squares, then clean them thoroughly. Score the surface of the squid, cutting almost through to the chopping board, in a lattice pattern, with a very sharp knife. Rub a little olive oil then 2 or 3 tsp of mild, smoked paprika into the squid and set aside. Wash and trim the head and tentacles. Make the paste. Peel 2 cloves of young, fresh garlic, slice them thinly and set aside. Toast 30g of skinned almonds in a shallow pan until golden and fragrant. Blend the almonds with 100g of tomatoes (I used green ones), 20g of basil leaves and stalks, 20g of parsley leaves and 100ml of olive oil. Trim 2 spring onions, then split them in half lengthways. Warm a ridged, iron griddle pan, then toast the sliced garlic on it until golden. Remove and blend with the tomato and basil sauce. Lower the spring onion and then the squid on to the hot grill, let it cook for a minute or two until it starts to curl, then add the tentacles. Serve the squid with the tomato, almond and basil sauce. Serves 2. Prepare the squid in advance, but cook it only at the very last minute. It takes but a minute or two to cook through. As soon as the flesh starts to curl, it is done. Make the sauce using tarragon, mint and parsley, instead of basil, stirring in a generous shot of lemon juice. This treatment works wonderfully with large prawns, too. Season them with the paprika with the shells on, then grill them as above, turning them once or twice during cooking. Eat the prawns with fingers rather than knives and forks, sucking the shells as you tear them from the prawns. Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@NigelSlater
