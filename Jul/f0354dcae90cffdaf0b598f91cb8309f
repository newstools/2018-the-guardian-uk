José Mourinho will only consider selling Anthony Martial for the right fee, with Manchester United’s manager preferring that the Frenchman move to a club outside the Premier League rather than to a direct rival. Mourinho had been minded not to allow the forward to depart but has shifted his stance. The Portuguese has reluctantly decided that if Martial does not wish to play for United then his leaving the club should at least be explored. The domestic transfer window closes on 9 August, the day before United’s Premier League season opener with Leicester City at Old Trafford. Mourinho has stated that Martial is likely to feature in the game. If he is to be sold Mourinho’s first-choice is for it to be to a club on the continent. The window in Europe’s major leagues closes on 31 August, with the one in Martial’s native France not closing until mid-September. Martial has a year left on his contract and the club has the option of adding another 12 months. If United activate that option it would markedly increase his market value. Martial cost an initial £36m that rises to £58m if all the clauses in his terms are met. It is likely the bidding from any suitors for the player would start at £50m. Martial has become disillusioned at United, losing the automatic starting berth he enjoyed in his first season under Louis van Gaal, having signed in summer 2015. The 22-year-old believed he needs to leave Old Trafford to reinvigorate his career.
