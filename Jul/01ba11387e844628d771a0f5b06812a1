Gary Lineker has become the BBC’s highest paid on-air talent and is the only one of the corporation’s big name male stars not to take a pay cut. Lineker, who fronts the BBC’s football coverage, is paid between £1.75m and £1.76m a year, supplanting at the top of the pay list the Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans, whose £2.2m salary has been reduced to £1.66m-£1.67m, partly as a result of quitting the BBC2 show Top Gear. A number of others have taken pay cuts – including the Today programme presenter John Humphrys, Radio 5 Live’s Nicky Campbell and the BBC News anchor Huw Edwards – as part of BBC efforts to redress a significant gender pay gap among on-air talent. However Lineker, who will not be fronting coverage of England’s World Cup semi-final against Croatia because ITV have exclusive showing rights, has not taken a cut. Tony Hall, the BBC director general, said that with the vast sums paid to those on and off the field in the world of sport, the corporation has no choice but to pay Lineker accordingly to retain him. After 4 weeks in Moscow, I finally get to go to a game. And what a game. Come on England. 🤞🤞🤞 “Lineker is doing the most amazing job and I hope he will do an amazing job when England are in the final on the weekend,” said Hall. “There is always going to be one or two people where the market for what they do is absolutely real, visceral. “When we are talking about a Lineker … we are talking about someone who has the option of going somewhere else and doing it. And there are people out there bidding for someone like that.” The BBC’s third-best paid star was Graham Norton, in the £600,000 to £610,000 bracket, fourth is the BBC Radio 2 presenter Steve Wright, on £550,000 to £560,000, with Edwards fifth, on £520,000 to £530,000. Of the 12 new entrants to make the list of those paid £150,000 or more, eight are women. The name to cause the most disgruntled murmurs in the BBC newsroom was Amol Rajan, a former editor of the Independent who joined two years ago as media editor, who is paid £200,000 to £210,000. This is the same as veterans such as Jeremy Bowen, the BBC’s Middle East editor, and more than Katya Adler, the BBC’s Europe editor, another new entrant.
