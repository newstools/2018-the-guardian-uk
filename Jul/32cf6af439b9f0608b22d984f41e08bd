Tony Parker’s heralded stint with the San Antonio Spurs is over after 17 seasons and four NBA championships. The six-time All-Star point guard has agreed to a two-year, $10m deal with the Charlotte Hornets, the Associated Press reported on Friday citing a person with knowledge of the negotiations. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Friday because the deal has not been signed. Parker lost his starting role with the Spurs last season. The move to Charlotte reunites him with former Spurs assistant James Borrego, who became the head coach in Charlotte earlier this offseason. Parker, the franchise’s career assists leader, averaged career-lows of 7.7 points and 19.5 minutes last season. He was part of 137 playoff wins with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, the second most by any coach and player in NBA history. Popovich and Spurs legend Tim Duncan combined for 157 playoff wins. Parker has also appeared in 17 consecutive postseasons; only Karl Malone and John Stockton’s run of 19 straight playoff trips are longer. Earlier Friday, the AP reported that Carmelo Anthony and the Oklahoma City Thunder have mutually decided that he will not be on the team next season, though it remains unclear how that departure will actually happen. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no buyout, trade or waiving has been executed, adding that Anthony would prefer to sign with a contender if he becomes a free agent. Anthony is due to make $28m this season, his last in a five-year, $125m contract he signed with New York before getting moved to Oklahoma City. He has said he will not accept a reserve role, and by parting with him – somehow – the Thunder could save more than $90m in luxury tax payments. Anthony averaged 16.2 points on 40% shooting last season, both of those being career-lows.
