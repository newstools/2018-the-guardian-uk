Frasier, the acclaimed sitcom about a snobbish radio psychiatrist, may be returning to TV. Deadline reports that the show’s star, Kelsey Grammer, has been pitching a reboot of the series to network executives. The reboot would feature a new setting, but would see Grammer reprise his role as the title character, Frasier Crane. A spin-off of the 80s sitcom Cheers, Frasier ran for 11 series between 1993 and 2004 on the US network NBC. The series saw Grammer’s character return to his hometown of Seattle and reconnect with his cantankerous father, Martin, played by British actor John Mahoney and fastidious brother Niles, played by David Hyde Pierce. Jane Leeves, who played Daphne, Martin’s physical therapist and love interest of Niles, and Peri Gilpin, who played Frasier’s radio producer Roz, also starred. Acclaimed by critics for its witty dialogue and strong characterisation, Frasier won a total of five Emmy awards for outstanding comedy series, a record figure that has only been matched since by Modern Family. Frasier’s finale, which saw Frasier leave Seattle for Chicago with his girlfriend Charlotte (Laura Linney), was watched by 33 million viewers. Aside from Grammer, it is unclear whether a potential reboot would feature cast members from the original series. Mahoney died earlier this year due to complications from throat cancer.
