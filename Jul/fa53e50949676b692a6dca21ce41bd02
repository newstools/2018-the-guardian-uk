Between 2002 and 2005 the Paris-born and US-based photographer Karine Laval made a series of photographs of public swimming pools and lidos in Europe. The series began with some pictures she took at a pool in Barcelona. Using a Rolleiflex camera she shot from below to capture the modernist jut of diving boards against the clear blue sky. Laval was drawn to her “poolscapes”, she has said, to recreate some of the languorous summer joy of her growing up; her pools are all about memory. The dazzling reflected light gives her pictures not only a painterly quality, but also the shimmer of half-recollection. Some of her images are all about the exhilaration of water, splash and noise; others, like this one, are more meditative. The best of them, like all the brightest days of summer, seem both real and imagined. As a later strand of the same series, Laval began taking photographs of abandoned or disused private pools in the US, pictures that seemed all about loss or mortality. You could perhaps convince yourself that you could feel that coda coming as you look at this picture. As David Hockney emphasised with his Californian pool scenes, there is always a dramatic narrative poolside, the before and after of taking the plunge. Given the dancing possibility of light implied in Laval’s picture, however, the figures on these diving boards resist that sudden change of state; they are curiously static, each apparently in an individual reverie. At some point, you imagine, they will have to drop into the water below, but for now they are stretching out the moment, not yet ready to submit to gravity. Poolscapes by Karine Laval is published later this month (Steidl, £35)
