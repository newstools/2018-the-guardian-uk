Formula One says any plan for a new race in Miami will not happen until at least 2020 as talks reached a point where delivering a race in 2019 could result in a “sub-optimal” street circuit. F1 and Miami officials hoped to stage the race in 2019 but competition officials announced on Monday that negotiations have taken too long to get the race on next year’s calendar. Sean Bratches, F1’s managing director for commercial operations, says negotiations have been complicated as the racing series tries to lay out the best possible street course. He said: “In the last few months we have worked diligently alongside our promoter Stephen Ross of RSE Ventures, the City of Miami and Miami Dade County, to realise our ambition to bring a Formula One grand prix to Miami, and we have made significant progress: however, these are complicated negotiations. “Whilst our preference would have been to race in Miami in 2019 there was always a point by which delivering the best possible wheel-to-wheel racing experience for our fans, drivers and teams wouldn’t be possible in the time available. We have now reached that point as far as racing in Miami in 2019 is concerned. “However, we are taking a long‑term view and as a result, we have decided, in consultation with the Miami authorities, to postpone sign-off until later in the summer, with the aim of running the first Formula One Miami Grand Prix in the 2020 season. “We have always said that we wouldn’t compromise on delivering the best possible race, for the people of Miami, our fans and the 1.8bn people who watch F1 globally every year, and if that meant waiting until 2020, then that was far more preferable than signing off on a sub-optimal racetrack, just to do a deal.” Bratches said F1 remains committed to trying to bring a race to Miami. F1, which has races in Austin, Texas and Montreal in addition to Mexico City, has said it wants to grow the series in the US.
