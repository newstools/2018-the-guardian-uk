Donald Trump has attacked the European Union’s decision to fine Google $5.1bn (£3.8bn) for “serious illegal behaviour”. The European commission announced the record fine on Wednesday after an investigation found the tech company had required smartphone operators to pre-install Google’s search and browser apps or lose access to its online store and streaming service. “I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!” Trump wrote on Twitter. I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long! His comments come amid escalating tension between the EU and the Trump administration. In an interview with CBS in Scotland last week, Trump described the EU as a “foe”. Asked to identify his biggest foe globally, Trump replied: “Well, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn’t think of the European Union, but they’re a foe.” His comment came as the two trading powers are a loggerheads over Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, a move that has sparked a global backlash and could lead to a worldwide trade war. Google announced on Wednesday that it would appeal against the EU fine. It came after Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said Google has used its Android mobile phone operating system “to cement its dominance as a search engine” and stifle innovation and competition in a way that “is illegal under EU antitrust rules”. In a statement Google said: “Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition. We will appeal the Commission’s decision.”
