A woman who was exposed to the nerve agent novichok in Amesbury, Wiltshire, died in hospital on Sunday evening. The Met police have launched a murder investigation. The woman was identified by police as Dawn Sturgess, 44, from Durrington. Her family has been informed and are receiving support from specially trained officers. A 45-year-old man who was also taken in remains in a critical condition in hospital. Assistant commissioner Neil Basu, the head of UK Counter Terrorism policing said: “This is shocking and tragic news. Dawn leaves behind her family, including three children, and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this extremely difficult time. “The 45-year-old man who fell ill with Dawn remains critically ill in hospital and our thoughts are with him and his family as well.“This terrible news has only served to strengthen our resolve to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible for what I can only describe as an outrageous, reckless and barbaric act.” On Saturday, a police officer who attended hospital over concerns he may have been exposed to novichok has been given the all-clear.
