Germany would only extradite the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to Spain on a charge of misuse of public funds, not the more serious charge of rebellion, a court has ruled. The separatist leader was held on a European arrest warrant in March while crossing into northern Germany on the way to Brussels, where he was living in self-imposed exile. Spanish courts want Puigdemont to go on trial for rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds for organising an illegal referendum in Catalonia that led to a unilateral declaration of independence in October, with the former charge potentially leading to a prison sentence of up to 25 years. On Thursday morning, the higher court in Schleswig-Holstein authorised Puigdemont’s extradition to Spain on the lesser charge of misuse of public funds, but rejected a request to send him back on grounds of rebellion. A spokeswoman for the court said: “The court decided this morning that an extradition due to the accusation of misuse of public funds is permissible.” The court thus rejected the German state prosecutor’s argument that the Spanish charge of “rebellion” could be equated with the German penal code’s charge of “high treason”. The ruling means Puigdemont, who has been living in Berlin since being released on bail in April, will not have to go on trial for rebellion in Spain if he is extradited via Germany. According to Reuters, a source close to Puigdemont’s legal team said he would nonetheless appeal a decision to extradite him from Germany on any charge.
