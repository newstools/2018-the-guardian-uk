England did not win the World Cup but they did manage to inspire and unite a country that has often felt divided of late. A large part of their impact and charm over the last few weeks has been the way they have handled themselves on social media, their preferred means of communicating with fans. The players were humble, open and at times very funny. Over the last 12 hours, as they come to terms with their defeat to Croatia and what they have achieved at the World Cup, they have been expressing their emotions to fans, each other, their manager and the country. It hurts a lot. It will hurt for a while. We can be proud and we'll be back. Thanks for all your support. #ThreeLions #ENG #WorldCup pic.twitter.com/mJKOWtAOlK Was an honour to represent my country at the world cup.
