Have you heard about Huji? It’s a photography app that takes your pics as though you were living in 1995 – it’s all warmth and grainy goodness. The softness of old photography pleases me, it makes people seem less plastic, situations seem less orchestrated and more lived in for that moment. Everyone looks fabulous, not a trout-pout in sight nor a contoured cheek. The app also enriches colour, which includes a tan. Being of mixed heritage, I’m often asked whether I can get a tan. Of course I can! Everyone goes darker in the sun. Is it a desire of mine ? Not particularly. I like to glow, but don’t pay very much close attention to the shade and also care too much about sun damage. If you are a tan seeker, though, try fake tanner to the stars Jules Von Shep’s brilliant range, Isle of Paradise. The products are vegan-friendly and organic, and the self-tanning drops can be added to your usual body moisturiser so that you can ‘control your glow’. That, plus Huji, and you’re on your way to Love Island-style bronze heaven.
