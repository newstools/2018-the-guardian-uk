Colombia’s ambassador to the UK has complained after the Sun published a front page that referenced the country’s links to the cocaine trade in the run-up to Tuesday’s World Cup clash with England. The headline reads: “As 3 Lions face nation that gave world Shakira, great coffee and er, other stuff, we say … GO KANE!” next to a picture of England striker Harry Kane. “It’s rather sad that they use such a festive and friendly environment as the World Cup to target a country and continue to stigmatise it with a completely unrelated issue,” said the ambassador, Néstor Osorio Londoño, who is hosting a party for Colombian fans in a traditional English pub on Tuesday. “Respect, fair play and joy for the game is all that matters tonight. We’ll be cheering for Colombia and hoping we can all enjoy a great match.” The ambassador also predicted it would be a high-scoring game, with Colombia winning 3-2. Local Colombian media were unhappy with the front page, with the website of broadcaster Caracol TV saying the headline “caused great upset” to Colombians. The Sun sent a reporter wearing an England shirt to Bogotá to interview Colombian fans about their fear of Kane’s goalscoring ability. A spokesperson for the newspaper said: “Like the ambassador, we’re looking forward to a good game tonight against a great footballing nation.” They said the front page was “suitably light-hearted considering the context” and said they hoped it would boost the Colombian coffee industry.
