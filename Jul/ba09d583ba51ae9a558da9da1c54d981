Police around the world have warned people against doing the “Kiki challenge”, after multiple people attempting the viral dance have been injured. The “Kiki challenge”, also known as the “In My Feelings challenge”, involves jumping out of a moving car and dancing alongside it to Drake’s hit In My Feelings, while the car continues moving. Some videos of the dances uploaded to the internet show oblivious dancers crashing into poles, tripping on potholes or falling out of the cars. One video shows a woman having her handbag stolen while attempting the challenge and another shows a man being hit by a car while he dances. Look at this 😂😂😂 #KekeChallenge pic.twitter.com/sqNNbvnP8B The craze began when internet comedian Shiggy posted a video to Instagram of himself dancing to the song. Since his video went viral, thousands of people have taken up the challenge. Celebrities, including Will Smith and Ciara, have joined in, posting their own videos of the dance – though neither jumped out of or danced alongside a moving car.
