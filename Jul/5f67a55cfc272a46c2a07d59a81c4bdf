Take a couple of whole chicken legs and remove the bones. (See below for guidance.) Mix together 4 tbsp of white miso paste, 2 tbsp of maple syrup or honey, 2 tsp of sesame oil and 3 tbsp of groundnut oil. Push the meat down into the marinade, cover and set aside in a cool place for a good 20 minutes, longer if you can. Heat an overhead grill. Line a grill pan with foil, place the chicken pieces on top and cook under the preheated grill for about 8 minutes then turn and grill the other side till golden. While the chicken is cooking, clean 350g of assorted radishes, slice them thinly and toss them with a little groundnut oil, rice vinegar and a handful of frisée or watercress. Remove the chicken from the grill and serve with the radishes and leaves. Enough for 2. Boning the chicken thighs: this is most easily done by placing the chicken skin-side-down on a kitchen board, then cutting down deep into the flesh following the lines of the bones (you can feel them with your fingers). Open up the flesh around the bones and tunnel them out leaving you with two flattish pieces of boneless chicken. Remove any sinews. I then usually bat the meat out lightly with a cutlet bat or rolling pin. Mackerel, cleaned and filleted, is good cooked in this way. It will need 5 or 6 minutes on each side. And I wouldn’t say no to some aubergine, each thick slice grilled then dipped into the miso marinade and reintroduced to the heat till golden and sticky.
