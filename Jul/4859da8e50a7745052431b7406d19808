Turkey is the best value holiday location in Europe this year, but the Costa del Sol is the cheapest in the eurozone, with prices in most Spanish resorts little more than half those charged in France and Italy, according to research by Post Office Travel Money. Although sterling has been weak against most international currencies, it has risen strongly against the Turkish lira over the past year. In summer 2017 holidaymakers were getting around 4.5 Turkish lira for a pound, but now tourists will pick up around 6 lira to the pound. The Post Office looked at a basket of “beach” goods, such as hiring loungers and pedaloes, and the cost of a family meal. It found prices in Marmaris on Turkey’s south coast were 36% cheaper than last July. Once all the items in the index were added together, Marmaris dislodged the traditionally cheapest resort in Europe, Sunny Beach in Bulgaria. The research also shows the remarkably good value holidaymakers can find in Spain. The Post Office said the average cost of a family meal on the Costa del Sol was just £40.72, compared to £98.31 in Nice, France, and a painfully high £129.08 in Sorrento, Italy. The Balearic islands have much higher costs than the mainland Spanish costas, with Ibiza ranked one of the priciest resorts in Europe. For boozers, a glass of wine on the Algarve in Portugal at just £1.13 was the cheapest in the survey, while in Poreč in Croatia and Ibiza it is likely to set you back more than £3.50. The Post Office said prices in Croatia have risen by about 18.5% since last summer, with sterling gently declining against the Croatian kuna for much of the past year. Prices in Limassol in Cyprus were also up significantly since last year. Separate research from car insurance firm Admiral found that Luton airport charged the most for parking, at £255 for two weeks when pre-booking its standard on-site car park, while Belfast was the cheapest at £63.
