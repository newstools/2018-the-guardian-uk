A protester accused of flying a paraglider into a no-fly zone set up to protect Donald Trump while he visited his Scottish golf course has been released from custody. The man was arrested and charged on Sunday after allegedly piloting the paraglider in front of the Trump Turnberry hotel on Friday, trailing a banner reading: “Trump: well below par.” Police Scotland said the incident was being treated as a breach of the air exclusion zone in place for the US president’s two-night stay. The 55-year-old man had been due to appear at Ayr sheriff court on Monday. But the Crown Office, which runs Scotland’s prosecution service, said he had instead been released pending further investigation. “The procurator fiscal at Ayr received a report concerning a 55-year-old man and an alleged incident on Friday 13 July,” a Crown Office spokesman said. “He was liberated from custody pending further inquiries and did not appear in court.” The environmental protest group Greenpeace said it was behind a stunt to protest Trump’s visit to the UK. The president and his wife, Melania Trump, stayed at the golfing resort, which he bought in 2014, on a private visit following his meetings with Theresa May and the Queen.
