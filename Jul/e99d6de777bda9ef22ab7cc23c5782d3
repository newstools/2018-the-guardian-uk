Maurizio Sarri and Jorginho were at Stamford Bridge on Friday evening to complete their moves to Chelsea. Sarri is taking over as manager from Antonio Conte, who left his job on Thursday. Chelsea confirmed Conteâ€™s departure on Friday with a 52-word statement. Jorginho has played under Sarri for the past three seasons at Napoli and has opted to join Chelsea rather than Manchester City. The midfielder, born in Brazil, is an Italy international. Negotiations to release Sarri from his Napoli deal took some weeks to conclude. He was replaced there by Carlo Ancelotti in late May but was not released from his contract, forcing Chelsea to pay a fee to secure him. The Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola is set to be given a role to work alongside Sarri.
