These are a variation on an American classic: lemon bars. If you’ve never tried them before, picture a layer of zingy, fruit curd on a buttery, shortbread base. I’ve used raspberries and lime here, but feel free to experiment with other citrus fruits; red grapefruit makes a particularly delicious alternative. Prep 20 minCook 45 minMakes 9 For the biscuit50g rolled oats100g plain flour60g caster sugar¼ tsp table salt150g cold unsalted butter For the curdZest of 3 limesJuice of 7 limes (about 175ml)1 tbsp cornflour3 medium eggs275g sugar75g raspberries, plus more to decorate Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Make the biscuit by blitzing the oats in a food processor until powdery. Mix in the flour, sugar and salt, then add the butter. Blitz again until you have a fine powder. Press the crumbs into a 24cm square tin lined with baking paper. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. Take out of the oven and set aside to cool. While the biscuit is baking, start making the curd. Put the lime zest and juice into a medium-sized saucepan, reserving a little of the juice. Put this into a small bowl and mix with the cornflour to form a paste, then add to the saucepan with the eggs and the sugar. Puree the raspberries in the food processor, then pass them through a sieve to separate the juice from the seeds. Add the juice to the saucepan and discard the seeds. Cook the curd over a medium heat for a few minutes, stirring constantly with a balloon whisk, until it starts to thicken. Remove from the heat and pour over the biscuit layer. Put the tart back in the oven for a further 20 minutes, by which point the curd will be bubbling away. Set aside to cool on a wire rack, then chill in the fridge before cutting into rectangules. Decorate each with a halved raspberry.
