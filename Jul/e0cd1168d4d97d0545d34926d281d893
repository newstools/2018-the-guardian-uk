England player Kieran Trippier is to be awarded the freedom of his home town of Bury after his stellar World Cup performance. The 27-year-old defender became only the third England player to score in a World Cup semi-final when his free-kick put Gareth Southgate’s men 1-0 up against Croatia on Wednesday. Victory for England was not to be, but Trippier was widely regarded as one of the team’s best players of the tournament. His performances are to be rewarded with a formal civic honour in the town in Greater Manchester where he grew up. “Kieran and his England team-mates have given a huge amount of joy for local people with their incredible performances during the World Cup,” said the leader of Bury council, Rishi Shori. “To reach the semi-final for only the third time in England’s history is an amazing achievement. I was nine years the old the last time it happened – I am a lot older now.” Shori added: “Kieran himself was outstanding, scoring a penalty in the shootout with Colombia and of course that unforgettable free kick against Croatia. He is now only third Englishman to have scored in a World Cup semi and certainly the first from Bury. “He deserves to be acknowledged. He is a huge role model to younger people and hopefully can inspire the next generation of footballers in Bury.” Trippier was born in the former cotton mill village Summerseat and attended two local schools, Holcombe Brook primary school and Woodhey high school, before joining Manchester City’s academy. Should he accept the honour – Trippier has not yet commented – the Tottenham Hotspur player will join others with the freedom of Bury including the film director Danny Boyle, the rock band Elbow and Jill Neville, a former councillor and the mother of England footballers Gary and Phil Neville and England netball head coach Tracey Neville. Shori said he was working with the Lancashire County FA and the Football Foundation to build 3G pitches in the borough and create “a positive legacy” from Trippier’s starring role in England’s World Cup campaign. Trippier and the rest of the England team are due to return to Birmingham on Sunday before going their separate ways. He posted on Twitter after England’s defeat to Croatia: Last night hurt and will for a while but we must take positives from the last few weeks and look forward to the future.What a great set of @England teammates and staff, it's been a journey we can be proud of. Thank you to all the fans out here and back home for your support🦁🦁🦁 pic.twitter.com/Aw43gMvg4K The medieval term “freeman” meant someone who was not the property of a feudal lord, but enjoyed privileges such as the right to earn money and own land. Town dwellers who were protected by the charter of their town or city were often free – hence the term “freedom of the city”. Today the title is regarded as an honour or award to people of note who have lived or worked in the town or city. • This article was amended on 15 July 2018.
