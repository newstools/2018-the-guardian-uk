Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Thinly slice 5 spring onions and soften them in a couple of tbsp of olive oil in a frying pan about 20cm in diameter set over a moderate heat. Break 4 eggs into the jug of an electric blender, add 10g of dill fronds, 8g of mint leaves and 15g of parsley, then process until bright green. Season with salt and pepper. Add 30g of butter to the spring onions and let it melt over a moderate heat. Pour in the egg and herb mixture, then crumble in 150g of feta cheese, add any sprouted seeds or micro salad leaves that you fancy (young chives, radish sprouts or sprouted pumpkin seeds are all good here) then bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes until lightly set. Allow to settle for 5 minutes then cut it into thick wedges and serve. Enough for 2 people. Timing is everything with this dish. You can get the herb and egg mixture ready in advance, but donâ€™t start cooking until you are ready to eat. Leave the finished baked eggs to settle before eating. Five minutes is just about long enough. But you can also eat it cold. Use a little asparagus, steamed and cut into short lengths in place of the sprouted seeds. At the end of cooking, introduce a few spoonfuls of chopped tomatoes that you have cooked with garlic and chopped basil to the eggs.
