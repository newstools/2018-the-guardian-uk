Awarded for the first time in 2006, Fifa’s best young player award is usually a hotly contested prize to honour the best player aged 23 or under. This time, however, there is surely no contest. Kylian Mbappé does not celebrate his 20th birthday until December but the France forward has been an undoubted star of the 2018 World Cup and will surely follow in the footsteps of the 2006 winner, Lukas Podolski, Thomas Müller in 2010 and France teammate Paul Pogba four years ago by taking the award. But which other eligible players have excelled in Russia? We select an XI of young stars. As one of only two goalkeepers under the age of 23 to have featured, the other being Tunisia’s Mouez Hassen, the teenager makes the cut almost by default but will still be relatively satisfied with his first major tournament despite Nigeria’s group-stage exit. Uzoho was largely helpless to prevent any of the four goals he conceded in the defeats by Croatia and Argentina and will surely improve with age. The next step for him is to gain first-team experience at Deportivo La Coruña, having spent the majority of last season in the reserves. Three goals in three World Cup matches is a record of which any striker would be proud, so to manage it as a defender is quite an achievement. Mina formed a powerful defensive unit with Davinson Sánchez, who is unlucky to miss out on selection after an impressive tournament. But Mina’s headers in the matches against Poland and Senegal and the last‑minute equaliser against England means he edges it. Everton are among the clubs interested in him if Barcelona deem him surplus to requirements. Playing alongside Diego Godín for club and country has helped to make him one of the best young defenders in the world, with a series of outstanding performances in Russia cementing that reputation. The last-minute goal against Egypt kickstarted Uruguay’s impressive campaign and his tears before the end of the defeat against France in the quarter-final will be an abiding memory of the 2018 tournament. Giménez is closing in on 50 caps despite not celebrating his 24th birthday until January. It was a cruel way for one of the outstanding young performers at the tournament to bow out. The deflection off Emil Forsberg that sent Sweden into a quarter‑final meeting with England at Switzerland’s expense was just about the only foot Akanji put wrong in his four matches in Russia and he looks set to have a successful career after moving to Borussia Dortmund in January for around €18m from his Swiss club Basel. A powerful figure with great timing in the tackle, he was outstanding in the 1-1 draw against Brazil. A relative unknown before the tournament, the Stuttgart defender has proved invaluable to France and capped his performances with a superb goal from outside the area against Argentina in the last 16. With doubts over the fitness of Djibril Sidibé, the 22‑year‑old has provided a solid base on the right flank and has allowed Kylian Mbappé to thrive in attack. Signed from Lille for only £4m in 2016 he is thought to be attracting attention from Manchester City, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, with the fee now likely to be north of £30m. Arsenal’s £22m signing from Sampdoria started the World Cup on the bench but his performance against Russia in the third group-stage match persuaded Óscar Tabárez he was worthy of a starting place. An all-round midfielder capable of influencing play in either box, the 22-year-old from Fray Bentos arrived in Europe three years ago and made more than 100 appearances in Italy. His performance in the last-16 win over Portugal – including one tackle that saw him shrug Cristiano Ronaldo off the ball – was simply outstanding. Earmarked as a future star of world football since he was included in the deal that involved Juventus selling Carlos Tevez to Boca Juniors in 2015, the cultured midfielder came of age during this tournament in Russia with a series of impressive performances at the heart of Uruguay’s talented team. With the full range of passes and an elegant playing style it seems only a matter of time before Betancur becomes a regular for Juventus having made 20 league appearances last season for the Serie A title winners. The Atlético Madrid player has established himself as a dependable presence in Les Bleus’ defence, filling a more orthodox left-back position in Didier Deschamps’ lop-sided formation. It has worked a treat as France have conceded only four goals, thanks in no small part to his speed and agility that augments a formidable backline led by Barcelona’s Samuel Umtiti and Raphaël Varane of Real Madrid. Hernandez signed a lengthy new contract with Atlético before the tournament and has been earmarked as Godín’s long-term replacement. Outstanding in the opening victory against Germany when his goal derailed the World Cup holders, Lozano was a constant threat for Mexico despite their failure to repeat that surprise start as the tournament progressed. His pace caused problems for every opponent and showed just why the 22-year-old is tipped to leave PSV Eindhoven this summer. A return of 17 goals and eight assists last season reportedly led Manchester United to make contact over a potential move for the player nicknamed “Chucky”. Considering he is three years younger than many players on this list, the achievements of France’s new superstar have been astonishing. From the barnstorming run from the edge of his own box to win his side a penalty against Argentina to the improvised skill from kick-off against Belgium that left Jan Vertonghen for dead, Mbappé has thrived in the knockout stages and looks already like a leading contender to win the Ballon d’Or. His club future could yet take him to Real Madrid as a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo, although it seems clear Mbappé will succeed wherever he plays. A controversial selection in the eyes of many England fans who criticised his performances during the group stages, Sterling showed glimpses of his true ability against Colombia before shining against Sweden and Croatia. Even if a lack of end product remains a major concern, the 23-year-old’s pace and skill provided a crucial outlet for Gareth Southgate’s side that was sorely missed after he was withdrawn in the semi-final. But he now faces a challenge from Riyad Mahrez for his place in the Manchester City side.
