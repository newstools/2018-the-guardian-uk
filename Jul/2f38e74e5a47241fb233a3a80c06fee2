Russell Simmons, the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, has been accused of rape. It is the latest sexual assault allegation against the music mogul. Alexia Norton Jones claims the attack happened in 1990, after she went to his apartment following a date. “It was such a fast attack,” she said in a first-person account published by Variety. “I must have said no seven to 10 times, and then I acquiesced. It was very fast. I would say it happened in less than 10 minutes.” Simmons has denied the accusation and says he is “deeply saddened” by Jones’s account. He says they “dated, were intimate and attended multiple events together after she alleges the incident occurred” – a claim Jones called preposterous, adding that she was “disgusted by him”. In a statement to the New York Times, Simmons said: “I have respectfully, factually and comprehensively denied the charges of sexual violence against me.” Numerous women have accused Simmons of sexual assault in recent months, beginning with Keri Claussen Khalighi in November 2017. Others include TV personality Kelly Cutrone, screenwriter Jenny Lumet, and nine other women who made allegations including sexual harassment and rape to the New York Times and Los Angeles Times. Simmons, who stepped down from his companies as the allegations began to increase, has repeatedly maintained his innocence, saying that any sexual relations were consensual; he has also issued a statement supporting the #MeToo movement. He is unlikely to face criminal proceedings over the allegations due to the length of time has elapsed since the alleged attacks. A civil lawsuit brought against him by film-maker Jennifer Jarosik, who accused him of rape, was dismissed in April.
