My wife and I have been together for more than 15 years and enjoyed a healthy sex life until I had a vasectomy four years ago, and started suffering from erectile dysfunction. My GP prescribed me the blue pills, but all they did was give me a terrible headache. My marriage became strained; erectile dysfunction takes away more than your sex life – it eats away at your confidence. We went to a psychosexual therapist, whom we saw for more than a year and we were put back together, slowly; through intimacy exercises then talk therapy. Last year, while making love, I started to feel pain in one of my testicles and was eventually diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, which I’m told is probably a result of the vasectomy. For the past six months, I’ve been on various tablets to try to cut out the pain, none of which has worked. I am now on pregabalin, an anti-epilepsy drug. The worst thing is, ejaculating makes it worse. Thirty seconds after I orgasm, it feels as if hot pins are being stabbed in to my testicle. My libido has crashed as a result and it’s undoing all the good work our therapist did. My wife and I talk a lot – she has patiently supported me, come to therapy every fortnight, and even now is considerate of my needs – but, understandably, is frustrated. She is the same age as me, 38: too young to live without a fulfilling sex life. I hope a solution comes through soon, and we can get back on track. We dare not think what might happen if this condition is permanent. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours? Email sex@theguardian.com
