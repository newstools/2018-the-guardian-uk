Gareth Southgate has taken England to their first World Cup quarter-final in 12 years and it seems he can do no wrong. Judging by the online reaction, there is absolutely nothing Southgate cannot do. #GarethSouthgateWould probably politely ask football if it wanted to come home first, then contact its parents and ask if it was okay. #GarethSouthgateWould listen earnestly to all that Glenn Hoddle has to say #GarethSouthgateWould stop the microwave at 0:01 so that it doesn't go off and wake everyone up whilst they are sleeping #GarethSouthgateWould never put empty wrappers back in the Quality Street tin. #GarethSouthgateWould take the Ring to Mordor... and throw it into the fire once he got there. #GarethSouthgateWould respectfully put in earphones to watch something on Netflix on public transport, but throw on the subtitles just in case anyone wanted to watch over his shoulder #GarethSouthgateWould never drive past McDonald's and tell you that you've got food at home #GarethSouthgateWould Pay an equal share of the restaurant bill, even though he didn't have a starter and only drank the tap water. #GarethSouthgateWould Know exactly at what angle to PIVOT when helping you upstairs with your new sofa. #GarethSouthgateWould stand in front of you at a gig, realise & immediately apologise and move a yard to the left #GarethSouthgateWould know what day to put the bins out after a Bank Holiday. And would let all his neighbours know just in case. #GarethSouthgateWould Knock and tell you if he was having a bbq next door and you had your washing out. #GarethSouthgateWould bring your parcel straight round as soon as you got home instead of waiting for you to come get it. #GarethSouthgateWould Run out and get your washing off the line if it started raining and you hadn't noticed. #GarethSouthgateWould throw away a pen which didn't work rather than just putting it back in the communal mug for someone else to pick up and deal with later. #GarethSouthgateWould let you go in front at the checkout with a full trolley when he‚Äôs only got a pint of milk #GarethSouthgateWould use a bookmark, instead of turning the edge of the pages down, if he borrowed a book from you. #GarethSouthgateWould reschedule Saturday's match for all those stressed "brides to be" out there who booked their weddings 18 months ago for 2pm on Saturday üôÑ #GarethSouthgateWould stop a conversation about Game of Thrones half way through and say ‚ÄúHas everyone seen it? Dave? No? Right then... let‚Äôs talk about something else so we don‚Äôt spoil it for Dave‚Äù #GarethSouthgateWould have stayed loyal in Casa Amor! #GarethSouthgateWould never run through a field of wheat #GarethSouthgateWould go back in time to Euro 96 and not change a thing because he knows it made him the man he is today.
