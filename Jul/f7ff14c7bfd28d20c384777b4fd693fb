Radiohead’s Thom Yorke has addressed the stage collapse that killed the band’s drum technician Scott Johnson in Toronto in 2012. Performing in the Canadian city for the first time since the incident, Yorke told the crowd at the Scotiabank Arena: “People are still not being held accountable in your city. The silence is deafening.” On 16 June 2012, the outdoor stage at Downsview Park collapsed an hour before the gates were due to open, killing Johnson, 33, and injuring three other crew members. In June 2013, Ontario’s ministry of labour brought charges against events promoter Live Nation, scaffolding company Optex Staging and engineer Domenic Cugliari, citing the province’s Occupational Health and Safety Act. All three denied any wrongdoing. In September 2017, following various hearings and delays, an Ontario judge put the charges against all parties on hold. Judge Ann Nelson ruled that delays meant the case had taken too long to come to trial. Ontario’s chief coroner announced they were launching an inquest into Johnson’s death in November 2017, but no date has been set. In a statement, Radiohead demanded more scrutiny: “While this is welcomed it does not bring those responsible for Scott’s death to account, and it provides no justice for his family.” On 18 July, Radiohead drummer Philip Selway appeared on Newsnight to discuss the “very frustrating” process. “There have been no real answers. Without the answers we can’t ensure that an accident like this can’t happen again.” "There have been no real answers... Without the answers we can't ensure that an accident like this can't happen again."
