Joachim Löw will continue as Germany’s head coach despite seeing his side eliminated during the group stages of the World Cup. The DFB confirmed on Tuesday that the 58-year-old, who signed a contract extension until 2022 in May, will remain in his post in spite of Germany’s shock exit in Russia, after defeats to Mexico and South Korea and a solitary win over Sweden. “I am very grateful for the belief that the DFB has shown in me and I feel, generally, that despite the justified criticism towards me, I feel a lot of support and encouragement too,” said Löw.
