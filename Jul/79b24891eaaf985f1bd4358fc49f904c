Lewis Hamilton has said how pleased he was to come away with a win at the Hungarian Grand Prix, having entered the weekend expecting to drop points to Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari. The British driver warned that his Mercedes team could not afford to let up in their fight with the Scuderia but he was optimistic that they would be strong in the second half of the season. Hamilton won from pole at the Hungaroring having enjoyed a dominant race on a circuit where Mercedes did not have the pace of the Ferrari. Hamilton had track position, however, and his team used it to ensure he took victory, with Vettel in second. As they go into Formula One’s summer break and coming after his win at the last round in Germany, Hamilton was beaming. “I really could only have dreamed that we would be in the position that we are in right now,” the British driver said. “Considering all factors and based on our pure performance, where we stand compared to the Ferraris. I am really happy, going into the break, particularly with back-to-back wins. I think that boost will last a long time for our team and it’s encouraging for everyone.” Hamilton now has a 24-point lead over Vettel with nine races remaining but has said he is taking nothing for granted in his attempt to win a fifth world championship. “I don’t believe there’s ever a moment that you’ve got your hands on the title or the trophy,” Hamilton said. “We’ve got a long way still to go. A lot can happen but what’s important is that we continue to keep up the pressure and keep working as we have done. “I think our work ethic has been very strong and the team morale is better than ever, the spirit is better than ever.”
