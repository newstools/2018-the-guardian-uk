Liam Gallagher has said he forgives his older brother Noel for their longstanding estrangement and has urged him to reform their band Oasis. In a tweet the younger sibling wrote: “Earth to noel ... I forgive you now let’s get the BIG O back together.” Earth to noel listen up rkid I hear your doing gigs where people can't drink alcohol now that's the BeZarist thing you've done yet I forgive you now let's get the BIG O back together and stop fucking about the drinks are on me LG x Liam added: “I’m not desperate just think it’d be a nice thing to do.” Fans of the band familiar to millions may think they don’t believe the truth, but it seems Liam genuinely wants Noel to get the band back together. But a possible rapprochement between the brothers may be tricky, given that in March Liam compared Noel and his wife Sara MacDonald to serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. On Twitter, Liam blamed MacDonald, Noel’s second wife, for breaking up the band, writing: “She’s the reason Oasis is no longer have to put it out there.” While Liam has a tendency to invoke world leaders (as well as serial killers) when insulting Noel, the insults are often flavoured with food references when they go the other way. Liam on Noel: Noel on Liam: Liam’s debut solo album, As You Were was a No 1 hit in the UK when it was released last October while his brother’s most recent record, Who Built the Moon? by Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds garnered his strongest reviews in decades a month later.
