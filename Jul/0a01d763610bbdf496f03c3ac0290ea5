Alexis Sánchez has resolved his visa issue and will fly out “shortly” to join Manchester United’s pre‑season tour of the United States. The Chilean was not with José Mourinho’s squad when it flew to Los Angeles on Sunday as he was not granted a visa by the US authorities. While this is thought to relate to Sánchez accepting a prison sentence from Spanish authorities in February, the forward now has been granted a visa and so can travel. A United spokesperson said: “Sánchez’s issue is all sorted and he will fly out to the USA very shortly.” Mourinho’s side face Club America in Phoenix on Thursday at 7pm local time, the opening game of the trip. They will then fly back to their LA base before travelling to San Jose to play the San Jose Earthquakes on Sunday, the second of a five-match stateside schedule.
