The bitter feud between the Oasis brothers is as legendary as their music, and two stadiums have now entered the fray amid rumours of a reunion concert. Liam Gallagher set the wheels in motion when he tweeted a message to his brother Noel on Thursday, suggesting an Oasis reunion. The Britpop star tweeted: “Earth to noel listen up rkid I hear your doing gigs where people can’t drink alcohol now that’s the BeZarist thing you’ve done yet I forgive you now let’s get the BIG O back together and stop f****** about the drinks are on me LG x.” He added in a second tweet: “Cmon.” There was radio silence from Noel but Oasis fans were sent into a frenzy over the potential reunion. Two stadiums then joined in the exchange by bidding to host the brothers’ comeback concert. Manchester City’s official Twitter account responded to Liam’s tweet by suggesting a show at the Etihad Stadium, to which Wembley Stadium mockingly asked: “What’s your capacity again?” Manchester City shot back: “What are your ticket prices again?” Wembley replied: “Why, which event do you want to come to? I warn you though most are sold out.” The final salvo from the unofficial Twitter account of Manchester City’s Etihad stadium was: “Not worth booking in future events. You could be sold off by then and turned into a car park 👀🚗.” To which Manchester City replied: “Love you x.” Hopeful fans may, however, be disappointed, as Noel told the BBC in November that he would never play with his old band again. Oasis split in 2009 after a row that reportedly began with Liam throwing a plum at his brother’s head. He has had chart success with his recent solo album while Noel is touring with his band High Flying Birds.
