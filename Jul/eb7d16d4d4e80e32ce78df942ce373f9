Amateur skywatchers and photographers from around the world ‚Äì as well as the stargazing professionals ‚Äì have sacrificed sleep to share spectacular images of the blood moon on social media. NASA put up a handy explainer (even though North and Central America were left out of the shade), and streamed the eclipse‚Äôs progress from a variety of planetariums across the world. What‚Äôs a blood Moon? How does the science behind an #eclipse work? Right now, a #LunarEclipse is underway in the sky over much of Earth‚Äôs population except North & Central America.

What a sight! So unreal to see the moon turn red. Check my story for behind the scenes! The shot you see here is a focal length blend! The moon was taken at 100mm while the foreground was taken at 24mm.

Arrived at South Perth around 2:30 am to take some photo of the Perth CBD skyline for the foreground. Then, I decided to head to Kings Park for a better view of the different phases of the moon. Unfortunately, it was too cloudy and I can barely see the moon. I managed to get the maximum eclipse but from then on the monstrous clouds took over, got home around 5ish. Well, better luck next time. üòÄüòÄ PS: I took the different moon phases separately and combined them all together. a7rii GM lens 70-200mm 2.8 A post shared by  Nicolai Abano (@nicolaiabano) on Jul 27, 2018 at 3:58pm PDT The #LunarEclipse #BloodMoon from Egypt on the Nile River pic.twitter.com/CKQvsXVTJB –õ—É–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∑–∞—Ç–º–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤—ã–≥–ª—è–¥–∏—Ç —Ç–∞–∫!

After weeks of much-celebrated sunshine and warm weather, thunderstorms and banks of cloud obscured the view for many. The irony was not lost. One tweeted that they had captured a great shot of the moon, accompanied by a video of storm clouds. Probably the best shot of the #BloodMoon you'll ever see.
