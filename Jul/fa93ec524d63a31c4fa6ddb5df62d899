The much-anticipated movie of Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s smash musical, wrapped two years ago – but won’t appear in cinemas for at least another two. According to a report in the The Wall Street Journal, a recording of the stage version was shot in 2016, shortly before the departure of Miranda from the cast, and it is this – rather than a film adaptation – which will be released. Citing two insiders, the paper said that it won’t be seen until at least 2020, presumably to maximise attendance at the stage versions still playing. Studios are apparently bidding for the rights to distribute, with a price tag of as much as $50m (£38m). Inspired by Ron Chernow’s 2004 biography about the founding father, Alexander Hamilton, the musical mixes hip-hop, R&B, pop, soul and show tunes. Opening on Broadway in 2015, it won 11 Tonys and the 2016 Pulitzer prize for drama, while the West End transfer won seven Oliviers earlier this year. Miranda will be seen in his first leading screen role later this year, opposite Emily Blunt in the forthcoming Mary Poppins sequel. Earlier this month, he announced his big-screen directorial debut: an adaptation of the play Tick, Tick … Boom!. Meanwhile, a film version of Miranda’s previous musical, In the Heights, is in the works, directed by Crazy Rich Asians’ Jon Chu – the director also now linked to a film about the Thai caves rescue.
