John Degenkolb has won stage nine of the Tour de France after a brutal day on the cobbles which saw Richie Porte crash out and Greg Van Avermaet extend his overall lead after finishing second. Degenkolb, Van Avermaet and Yves Lampaert formed a three-man breakaway with two sectors of cobbles to go after an earlier breakaway was reeled in. Degenkolb, severely injured in a training accident in 2016, had to sprint from the front 200m from the line, but held off Van Avermaet for a famous win. Sunday’s stage featured 15 stretches of pavé – the most cobbles in a Tour stage since 1983. Although the weather was warm and dry, that didn’t stop a series of crashes affecting the overall race leaders. Porte went down after just 10km, and had to abandon the Tour for the second year in a row after suffering a shoulder injury. BMC team-mate Tejay van Garderen also lost time after suffering a crash, while Romain Bardet suffered a series of mechanical problems. Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas both crashed after Team Sky colleague Gianni Moscon went over on the cobbles, but were able to stay with the main group. Thomas lies second on the general classification, 43 seconds behind Van Avermaet. “[I’m feeling] pure happiness,” said Degenkolb, fighting back tears. “I’ve been chasing this victory for so long. It’s really hard to describe. It was a really hard day. We had a plan to stay out of trouble, and that worked out really well. I have been through a lot of things in the past, and had such a hard time. “I’d like to dedicate this victory to one of my best friends, who passed away last winter. This was for him. Everyone said I was finished after what happened [in 2016]. I’m so thrilled to get a big race victory.” The riders will now have a well-earned rest day in Annecy, before the race heads to the Alps on Tuesday. • Jeremy Whittle’s report will appear later
