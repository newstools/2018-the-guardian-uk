Geraint Thomas is expecting the worst but hoping for the best in the final mountain stage of the 2018 Tour de France, which is also likely to be one of the most gruelling in this year’s race. Stage 19, from Lourdes to Laruns, is the fourth longest in the 2018 Tour and has six categorised climbs en route. The sting comes in the final 80 kilometres and this is where the Welshman’s Tour is likely to be won or lost. The climbing begins in earnest at the foot of the Col d’Aspin but when the peloton turns on to the slopes of the Col du Tourmalet, at 2,115 metres, one of the most revered – and loathed – climbs in the French Pyrenees, his hold on the maillot jaune will surely be tested. The long descent from the Tourmalet leads into a succession of climbs, beginning with the Col des Borderes, which leads to the steep Col du Soulor, which in turns climbs to the final super-category climb of the Col d’Aubisque. The descent too, a 20km drop to the finish in Laruns, may be pivotal. “We’re expecting the worst and hoping for the best,” Thomas said when asked about the stage. “We’re expecting a lot of attacks, maybe even on the Tourmalet and certainly on the last climb. “It’s the last mountain stage and guys will try to take any opportunity they can.” However, he also anticipated the potential for his rivals to over-reach themselves. “They can do a big move and quite easily lose a chunk of time in the time trial.” Thomas, though, admitted that his focus was on the final hours of mountain climbing. “Hopefully we won’t have to use Froomey,” the Welshman said of the defending champion, and his Sky teammate, Chris Froome, “and we will have strength in numbers but having him at my disposal is phenomenal.” “Hopefully he won’t have to do much. It will be a big test, and one for the team to control but obviously the last climb will be down to the legs.”
