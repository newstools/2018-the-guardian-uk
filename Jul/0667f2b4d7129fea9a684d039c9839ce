Stanislav Cherchesov said his plan to nullify Spain had worked to perfection after Russia beat the 2010 champions to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup. The hosts’ surprise victory on penalties followed a gritty defensive performance that their coach revealed he had devised in response to the threat posed by Spain. “I really had to persuade [my players] that this was the only way out,” said the Russia manager. “We don’t like this kind of structure but this is what we had to do with three defenders. Thank God my footballers understood what I was telling them. They trusted me. “I spoke with every player individually more than I had in the past and I had to explain to them why, where, what, and it has worked out as you see. I believe that my players have been victorious because they have adhered to my strategy.” The victory ensured Russia have reached the last eight for the first time since they competed as the Soviet Union in 1970 although Cherchesov, who had received a phone call from Vladimir Putin a few hours before the game, played down the excitement generated across the country and insisted he was focused only on their next match. “My emotions are simple,” he said. “You show your emotions in how you direct the team. Now it’s over and I’m thinking only about the next game. These are very simple, not very sophisticated emotions. That’s how it is.” With Spain having followed the holders, Germany, out of the World Cup, Cherchesov – a former goalkeeper who was appointed in August 2016 – acknowledged it had created an opportunity for the teams left in. “It has never been this way that so many favourites lose and go out,” he said. “This is football. What can you say?”
