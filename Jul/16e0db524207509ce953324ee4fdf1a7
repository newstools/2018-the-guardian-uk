Today’s Sun front page bears no surprises as the Trump interview was theirs: “May has wrecked Brexit … US deal is off!” The rest of us love the story too: the Guardian’s version is “Soft Brexit will ‘kill’ UK hopes of US trade pact”. Very similar line taken in the Telegraph – “May’s soft Brexit will kill chance of US trade deal” … … and the Times: “May’s Brexit will kill US trade deal, says Trump”. The FT sticks with the Brussels backlash: “Nato allies bridle at Trump claim of pledge to lift defence spending”. The Mail’s third edition calls it “President’s Brexit attack on May” and goes on that “he suggest Boris would make a great PM”. The Express splash is the “Tory revolt over May’s Brexit plan” but it puts the bad American house guest across the top: “Trump drops a bombshell on May by saying: I want Boris as PM’”. “Donald Thump” is what the Mirror calls him, also referring to it as a “bombshell”. The i’s effort: “Trump flies into diplomatic storm”. But maybe it’s the Metro that best has the measure of the man: “Trump – Brits like me a lot”.
