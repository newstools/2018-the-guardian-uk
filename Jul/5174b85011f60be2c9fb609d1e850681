Amanda Taylor, a London-based English teacher, is behind the hashtag #peoplewalkingpastwalls. Since she started it five years ago, more than 90,000 photos of strangers walking city streets have been shared by Instagrammers across the world. “I was into street art back then,” she says. “I wanted to share the street art on my feed and put my own stamp on it at the same time. This was the perfect way of doing it.” When Taylor takes her own photos, she finds the anticipation of “waiting for someone appropriate to walk by and the thrill of catching someone mid-stride at just the right moment exciting”. “I’d sometimes spend up to an hour waiting for the right person to walk by,” she says. Instagram users have been sharing photos with the hashtag from Reykjavik to Shanghai. Each week Taylor and her fellow curator @maco_kirahvi select the best photographs to share on the account @peoplewalkingpastwalls. “Sometimes it’s sheer luck, other times there’s an element of skill involved in getting the right person with what they’re wearing to complement the wall behind them,” Taylor says of what makes the hashtag so popular. “Aesthetically, there’s something really appealing about combining a wall, whether it be plain, colourful, covered in street art or a strong architectural structure, with a person in the foreground with a good stride.” Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.
