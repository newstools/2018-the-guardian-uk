1) The Tour de France reaches its conclusion in Paris this weekend, which makes it worth a quick look back at the most memorable finishes on the Champs-Élysées. In 1991, elbows-out sprinter Djamolodine Abdoujaparov wore green into the final stage (despite controversy after he had forced Johan Musseeuw into the barriers on an earlier stage) but crashed on the final sprint – yet clung on to the jersey when the team got him over the line. But that finish pales into insignificance next to the 1989 finish, when Greg LeMond overcame his deficit to Laurent Fignon to time trial his way to victory in 1989. And how does it feel to ride in the peloton around Paris – a little bit like this. 2) There’s a lot to unpick in the trailer to Final Score, filmed at West Ham’s former Upton Park stadium, but perhaps the key moment is when Tony Cottee appears to witness an execution. 3) It’s 8,611 metres high, only 300 people have managed to climb it, and one person in every four who reaches the summit dies. So why wouldn’t Poland’s Andrzej Bargiel ski down K2, becoming the first man in history to do so? 4) It’s pre-season friendly, er, season. Lautaro Martínez’s pass creating Inter’s goal against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane: woof! And while the Blades were drawing with Inter at Bramall Lane, Wednesday got into a mass brawl at Mansfield. 5) We’re not quite sure what FC Tokyo’s youth team were trying to do here, but it certainly didn’t work. In other bad ideas: barefoot waterskiing is tricky. 6) Billy Monger, the teenage British racing driver who lost both legs in a car crash in 2017, takes Daniel Ricciardo’s ‘shoe-y’ celebration and ups it after returning to driving. 1) Paul McBeth delivers a Disc Golf round for the ages. 2) A silky AFL finish from St Kilda’s Jack Steven: Spotter’s badges: whoboughtoranges, GrahamClayton.
