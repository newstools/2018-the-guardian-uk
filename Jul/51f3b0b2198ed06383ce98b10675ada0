Lizzy Yarnold avoids lingering in her sitting room because of the bad memories it stirs. She lives in a cottage 10 miles inland from Portsmouth, thoughtfully decorated, including intricate Lego models of Tower Bridge and The Simpsons’ house, constructed with husband James, and a small vegetable patch in the back garden. It is an idyllic setting but in the four months since winning a second Olympic skeleton gold it has been the scene of an agonising daily battle. “I try not to go in that room too much because there is a grey sofa in there which I spent weeks just lying on and crying,” she says. “In the morning I’d take an industrial amount of painkillers and lay there waiting for them to take effect.” It is only now that Yarnold, 29, feels comfortable enough to talk in detail about the chronic back pain which meant she underwent spinal surgery in June and has still not been able to properly celebrate becoming Great Britain’s most successful Winter Olympian. “I know this is a conversation I need to have,” she says, “to try and show the truth behind the smiles and everything you might see on social media. There’s the price of having been successful. “At the moment I can see this gold medal but I can’t pick up the letters that drop through the letterbox. I’m hoping over time when I recognise the impact of the gold medal, through going to schools and talking to kids, that it will feel like it was worth it.” Yarnold had been hoping to avoid surgery and is glassy eyed when recounting the moment she realised there was no realistic alternative. “The doctor said: ‘You can’t stay on this amount of medication.’ As an athlete that’s hard to hear but I had to face up to that. They cut a hole in my spine and chipped out bits. On the notes it says “harvesting loose fragments from Lizzy’s spine”. Yarnold started her career as a track and field athlete, specialising in heptathlon. Even before switching to skeleton a decade ago, she had a bad back. But she is also aware that hurtling down an icy track at 80mph an estimated 1,500 times, in training and competition, will not have helped. “Yes, my back is going to be worse in 10 or 20 years because I’ve been an athlete but I wouldn’t have ever chosen a life without sport so it wasn’t a sliding doors thing. In 2012 I had a back seizure in a gym in Calgary and couldn’t move for hours. “The muscles on either side of the spinal column seize up and it’s intense pain. At the world championships in Königsee in Germany in 2017 we were packing up afterwards and I was crawling on the floor in the bathroom to get the shower gel, crawling over to my bag to put it in, and I didn’t really think anything of it because I’ve always had a bad back.” At the Sochi Olympics in 2014, Yarnold won gold to justify her position as favourite having dominated the season, but four years later in South Korea it was a different story. She had taken a year out after Russia and had mixed fortunes after returning. What her fellow competitors did not know is that six months before Pyeongchang, she had also discovered a growth in a knee. Yarnold was warned the tumour could be cancerous but only a biopsy would be able to determine the cause of the problem and the medical team said the risk was low. She opted to continue on to the Games without having surgery. Further obstacles were thrown up on arrival in Pyeongchang. First, there was the onset of a chest infection. “We were staying on the seventh floor of the hotel and had Belgium and New Zealand above us and only one lift. If I was coming out at the seventh floor I could see the other nations thinking: ‘Why can’t you just walk up the stairs?’ They weren’t heated so there was ice on the windows. I started walking up and down everyday and the pain in my chest worsened to the point I was unable to speak. The first day of competition I was in the warm-up bit on the bike coughing up sweet-corn-sized bits of phlegm and struggling to breathe. The doctor listened to my chest and said: ‘You’re really ill, you’ve got a really bad chest infection but there’s nothing I can do for you now.’” On the first day of competition she also suffered a flare-up of a vestibular disorder which makes her dizzy and disorientated. “After my first run I went to the bathroom, took off my suit and couldn’t see anything,” she says. “I said to Louise Turner, the physiotherapist: ‘If I go again is it going to kill me?’ It sounds dramatic but it felt extreme, like life and death. I don’t know if I’m going to lose orientation within the first few corners and then you’re just going to be a rag doll at 80mph. She assured me there would be doctors at the bottom of the track who knew what was going on.” Yarnold managed to maintain third position overnight and her condition improved the next day; she created history by becoming the first Briton to successfully defend a Winter Olympic title. She overhauled Janine Flock of Austria on the fourth and final run, while her British team-mate and close friend Laura Deas claimed bronze. She had been looking forward to lengthy celebrations but just weeks later underwent a knee operation. Being on crutches seemed to worsen her back pain and she was diagnosed with two displaced discs. “I went to friends’ houses and I’d be able to sit and have dinner for five or 10 minutes and then I’d have to go to lie down in their lounge in my one no-pain position,” she says. “When I got the honour of the OBE, the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association office sent me this amazing bunch of flowers and I had to go and collect them. I was so angry because I was thinking, ‘I don’t want flowers, I want to be able to go to the toilet without having pain.’ It made it really difficult that people were saying well done, without knowing what I was going through. “I wanted to scream: ‘I wish you knew the truth.’” Yarnold did not get into sport to be a role model but it is a responsibility she takes very seriously. She is also outspoken about the need for mental health to be of paramount importance in athletes. “I’m seeing someone for support. If everyone could see a therapist that would be an amazing thing. The hardest thing is admitting you are struggling. “I haven’t been able to drive so I’ve been getting the train to school appearances. Because I can’t sit up I would have to lie across two train seats with my feet dangling off the end. Someone even tweeted me saying: ‘I thought it was you and wanted to say hi but you really didn’t look like yourself.’ I felt very guilty that I wasn’t the athlete that they wanted me to be.” The physical trauma has understandably taken a toll on her relationships and the dynamics of daily life. “I’m a very independent person,” she says. “But it’s now just [a case of] taking things day by day. If I’m not flooded in tears my husband James knows it’s a good day.” Because of the cocktail of powerful painkillers Yarnold has been taking for the past four months, her memory is fuzzy and she cannot yet contemplate returning to competition. What she really wants is to be healthy and enjoy the fact she had made history. If anyone is low on staples I've got 14 spare! I'm free from my big dressing!! 2 weeks post op the surgeon gave me a '👍 you've healed well'.The biggest thanks goes to Mr James for retaping my bandage most days, for cooking lots of recovery meals and always smiling when I'm sad. pic.twitter.com/mrgx0LNPdl At the side of Yarnold’s fridge are several unopened bottles of champagne. She bought a case from a vineyard in New Zealand and gave a bottle to each of her coaches. “Because I can’t drink alcohol on this medication it’s all just sat there,” she says. “It’s a simple thing but I’m a Guinness person and I could really do with a pint of Guinness right now.” Hopefully she will be able to properly toast her successes soon.
