Dominic Raab, a Brexit-supporting minister, has been promoted to replace David Davis as Brexit secretary, No 10 has announced. Raab was previously housing minister and replaces Davis, who resigned late on Sunday night saying he could not longer support government policy after the “soft Brexit” Chequers declaration last week. Other names that had been canvassed for the appointment included Michael Gove, the environment secretary, David Lidington, the cabinet office minister, and Chris Grayling, a May loyalist who is the transport secretary. Raab was one of the first names mentioned when sources briefed ahead of the Chequers summit that a “talented new generation” of MPs were ready to take the place of cabinet ministers if they resigned. Chief whip Julian Smith is said to have met with Raab before the summit.His name has been frequently mentioned by colleagues who believe the Conservative leadership should skip a generation. Though he is a Brexit supporter, he comes from the liberal tradition of the party. But some of his past gaffes could come back to haunt him, including once branding feminists “obnoxious bigots” in 2011.
