Daniel Cormier could hardly believe his eyes. Sure, he’d been supremely confident he would get the job done. That’s why, despite holding the UFC’s light heavyweight championship, he moved up to challenge heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic in the main event of UFC 226 on Saturday night. Cormier paced around the octagon and kept muttering to himself, surely in shock of what he just accomplished. A single, crushing right hand in the clinch laid Miocic flat on his back Saturday before a sold-out crowd of 17,464 at T-Mobile Arena, and then DC jumped on his foe, raining blows on his bloody face until the referee jumped in at 4:33 of the first round. “I was a heavyweight for a long time and I left the division before I knew what I could become. Now, I know the answer, I’m the new champion!” said Cormier (21-1), who was the UFC’s No 2 heavyweight when he dropped down to light heavyweight in 2014 rather than challenge his best friend, heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez. “I am 39 years old and I’ve been second many times but today I have accomplished everything I ever wanted. Brock Lesnar confronts Daniel Cormier inside the octagon after being called out by the new two division Champ ! #UFC226🔥 pic.twitter.com/TITqA6TBgz “Now there’s a guy who I’ve known for a long time. I never thought I’d get to fight him. He’s another wrestler, another All-American, and Brock Lesnar, get your ass in here! Lesnar stormed the octagon, clad in a three-piece suit, and immediately shoved the newly crowned champion before security intervened. The two went nose-to-nose, setting up what is sure to be a megafight between the second man in UFC history to simultaneously hold titles in different weight classes and the crossover star, who held the UFC heavyweight title from 2008-10 in between stints while becoming one of World Wrestling Entertainment’s biggest attractions. That fight is expected to be the main event of UFC 230 at New York’s Madison Square Garden in November, according to multiple reports, though UFC president Dana White could not confirm the date at Saturday’s post-fight press conference. “We’re definitely going to make that fight,” White said. Lesnar remains a part of WWE’s roster, but according to White, “he’s free and clear to do this fight. “Him and (WWE chairman) Vince (McMahon) have a good relationship. He’s not going to do anything to piss Vince off. I don’t know the specifics, but he’s good.” For a promotion that desperately needs star power and massive events, Cormier v Lesnar shapes up as a healthy serving of each. Conor McGregor is MMA’s biggest star, but he hasn’t competed since his dalliance in a boxing ring with Floyd Mayweather in August. His last appearance in an Octagon? November 2016, when he defeated Eddie Alvarez. When the Irishman will return is anyone’s guess. He faces a 26 July return to court in New York to face charges of criminal mischief and assault stemming from a fracas he ignited in April when he tossed a dolly at a bus transporting fighters days before UFC 223. With McGregor (the other man to hold two titles at the same time) sidelined and Ronday Rousey now a WWE star, Lesnar is far and away the organization’s biggest draw. Except he, too, is a WWE star, where he performs on a part-time schedule. But with his impending return, coupled with Cormier’s incredible performance, the UFC has another hot event on its hands. “Miocic is a piece of shit. Cormier’s a piece of shit. D.C., I’m coming for you, motherfucker! Lesnar shouted in the opening salvo of the promotion for his first title fight since October 2010, when he surrendered his belt to Velasquez. Cormier, an avid WWE fan, knows how to sell a fight, too. He was quick to call Lesnar out even while soaking in the adulation of the sold-out crowd on hand and replied to Lesnar’s placing his hands on him swiftly. “You can shove me now and go to sleep later! Hey, Brock, get out of my Octagon, I’ve got some pictures to take.” And with that, Cormier jumped up and straddled the top of the cage, a belt draped across each of his broad shoulders. He’s long been recognized as one of the sport’s true good guys, and on this night, he earned his piece de resistance. Miocic (18-3) was regarded as the UFC’s No 2 pound-for-pound fighter, and he was the favorite to retain his title. However, the 35-year-old Ohio native was no match for Cormier, who opened up a gash under the champion’s right eye before he finished him off with less than 30 seconds remaining in the opening round. Miocic was in no mood to discuss how Cormier v Lesnar might play out and only offered up that it simply “wasn’t his night,” his face gashed up and swollen. White was worried the fight wouldn’t take place at all. One day after he lost the co-main for UFC 226 when Max Holloway was forced to withdraw from his title defense against Brian Ortega due to lingering concussion symptoms, Cormier slipped off the stage at Thursday’s news conference and landed on his back. According to White, Cormier hurt his leg during the fall and the Bay Area native had to apply ice to reduce the swelling. This followed a back injury Cormier sustained during camp that forced him to abstain from training for some time. Finally, Cormier called White around “midnight, one in the morning” and said, “I feel good”. White let out a sigh of relief. Days earlier, White received another dose of good news when Lesnar called him to apologize for going “dark” and informed him he’d be Octagonside to take in Cormier-Miocic. The 40-year-old ended a nearly five-year absence from the octagon with a decision victory over Mark Hunt in July 2016, but Lesnar tested positive for the banned substance clomiphene and the result was overturned to a no contest. Lesnar still must be cleared by the US Anti-Doping Association (Usada), the agency which oversees drug testing for the UFC. He was handed a one-year suspension, but when he retired for a second time, the ban froze. Now, he’ll have to re-enter the testing pool and will have a little more than six months to wipe out the remainder of his suspension, meaning he’s won’t be eligible to fight again until January. So while he waits for Lesnar, Cormier said he could defend his light heavyweight title in November, though he acknowledged it would be difficult to get up for anything that’s doesn’t represent a major fight with Brock in his sights. “[Lesnar] was acting like a lunatic, he was fired up,” White said. “His gut told him Stipe because he felt Cormier put too much weight on for this fight, he thought it was going to affect him. But it didn’t. “This finally gives [Cormier] the respect that he deserves and he’s a two-division champion and now he’s got a big fight ahead of him. Big fight, big payday; it couldn’t happen to a better guy, he’s an incredible ambassador for the sport.” And now, Cormier will deliver a pay-per-view bonanza, too. Lesnar competing against anyone in a legitimate fight is a must-see event. But to pair him with a fighter the ilk of Cormier, and coming off a first-round destruction to win the heavyweight championship? Music to White’s ears, who could hardly stop smiling at the post-fight news conference. UFC 226 pulled in $5,677,238.21 at the gate and will rake in millions more in PPV dollars. More so than the tremendous payday a fight with Lesnar will deliver, this was deliverance for Cormier. Nearly one year ago, Cormier was turned into a meme when he was left crying after a second defeat to Jon Jones. The result was changed to a no contest after Jones tested positive for the banned substance turinabol, and Cormier’s title was back in his arms. The sting of defeat remained, though, but he exorcised those demons with his right hand, and now he’s living a dream: a fight with the WWE champion, and all the trash talk that accompanies it. “Brock Lesnar is the champion of the WWE,” said Cormier, who acknowedled he watched WrestleMania earlier this year, some WWE programming this week and that he even hung out with Lesnar as a fan at past wrestling events. “When he comes over here, there’s no script, no pulling on the punches. “He can be big and bad and tough right now, but when that cage door closes, he’s going to answer for his words, and he’s definitely going to answer for that shove.” Cormier said he won’t compete past 20 March 2019, and he plans to stage two fights before then. Will Jones be standing across from him in one of those bouts? Maybe. But Cormier made it clear that the monkey is off his back, even if he never faces his mortal enemy again. “[Jones] may have won the fights but I hold the cards now,” he said. “I’m the one who went up and did something that you were not going to do. I don’t need him. “This, tonight, is for everyone who said ‘you’re a fake champion.’ You can’t question this one. You might question that light heavyweight title, you can question it to the grave, but I have something completely separate from him and I’m grateful for it.” And this time, his eyes weren’t welled up with tears. They were beaming with jubilation at what Cormier called “destiny”.
