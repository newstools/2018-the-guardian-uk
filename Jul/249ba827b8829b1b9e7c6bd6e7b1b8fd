Roger Federer’s quest for a ninth Wimbledon crown gained momentum with a flawless 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 second-round win over the Slovakian world No 73 Lukas Lacko in 89 minutes. The Swiss defending champion has now won 26 consecutive sets at the All England Club. “I felt good, less nervous than in the first round,” Federer said. “Lacko can play well on the grass, he’s won his fair share of matches. Not wasting too much energy in the first matches is nice to have. From my end I’m very happy.” Federer won 35 straight points on his own serve en route to beating Lacko and advancing to the third round. He did not drop a point on his serve in the entire second set and kept that streak going until he was 30-0 up at 4-1 in the third, when Lacko sent a backhand winner down the line. In total, the eight-time champion lost only nine of 61 points on his serve and broke Lacko five times, including with a forehand winner to close out the match.
