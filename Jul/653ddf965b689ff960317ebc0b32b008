Novak Djokovic is Wimbledon champion for a fourth time, the former world No 1 defeating South Africa’s Kevin Anderson in straight sets: 6‑2, 6‑2, 7‑6 (3). Djokovic, seeded 12th, claimed his 13th major title overall while for Anderson the wait for a first grand slam title continues. Both men endured five-set epics to book their places in the final. Anderson finally defeated John Isner 7-6 (6), 6-7 (5), 6-7 (9), 6-4, 26-24 in their semi-final on Friday night. “My feet are sore, they’re swollen,” the 32-year-old South African said after his victory. “The legs are jelly-like.” Djokovic, meanwhile, was forced to battle with Rafael Nadal over two days during their semi-final until he sealed victory on Saturday: 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (9), 3-6, 10-8. Anderson came into the final with a 6-1 losing record against Djokovic and the Serb’s intentions were clear when he broke the eighth seed’s serve in the opening game of the match. With another break in the fifth game Djokovic cruised through to win the first set 6-2 – helped along the way by nine unforced errors from Anderson, whose efforts in reaching the final appeared to have caught up with him. Djokovic was showing no signs of fatigue as he went on to secure the second set 6-2. Anderson struggled to cope with the Serb’s baseline attack and was broken again in the opening game. At 2-5 down the South African earned his first break point of the match but but placed a backhand just over the baseline in a 15-shot rally and two points later Djokovic took the set with a service winner. A fourth Wimbledon crown was now within Djokovic’s grasp, but he encountered stern resistance in the third set from a revived Anderson and was taken to a tiebreak. The Serb would not be denied, though, and secured his 13th grand slam title. Kevin Mitchell’s match report from Wimbledon will follow.
