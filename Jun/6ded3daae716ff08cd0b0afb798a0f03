A third Legally Blonde film is on the way, with reports suggesting Reese Witherspoon is to reprise her role as idealistic lawyer Elle Woods – 15 years after her last outing as the character. According to Deadline, Legally Blonde 3 is being backed by MGM, who are looking to bring back much of the talent that made the first film, released in 2001, a surprise commercial success. Writers Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith (who subsequently collaborated on Ella Enchanted, She’s the Man, and The House Bunny) are back on board. Witherspoon – who in the interim has become a powerful behind-the-scenes figure with executive credits on Gone Girl, Wild and TV’s Big Little Lies – will produce, along with Marc Platt. Though Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde was released in 2003, a popular touring musical has kept memories of the films alive as well as introducing them to a new generation of viewers. No details of Legally Blonde 3’s plot have been released, but Deadline is speculating that it will be “about female empowerment”.
