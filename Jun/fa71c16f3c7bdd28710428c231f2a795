The Mercury prize-nominated rapper J Hus has been arrested and charged with carrying a knife. The 23-year-old, whose real name is Momodou Jallow, was arrested on suspicion of being in possession of a knife or bladed article after police stopped a vehicle near Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, on Thursday. J Hus, who was nominated for three Brit awards this year, was denied bail at Thames magistrates court on Friday and will remain in custody until his trial on 20 July. A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “Officers in a marked police car stopped a vehicle in International Way E20, at about 12.35pm on Thursday 21 June. The occupants of the vehicle were searched and a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being in possession of a knife/bladed article.” The Mobo award winner is scheduled to appear at several gigs and festivals this summer, including London’s Wireless festival on 7 July, but his attendance now appears to be in doubt.
