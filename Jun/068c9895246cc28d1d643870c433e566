The drama of England’s last-gasp win in their opening World Cup match against Tunisia on Monday sparked a wave of exuberant celebrations among fans, many of which were captured and widely shared on social media. The O2 Academy in Leeds was one of many venues across the country that was not only showing the match on big screens, but was also primed to capture fan reaction from the key moments of the game. They were rewarded with footage of the absolute scenes that followed captain Harry Kane’s 90th-minute winner. Who doesn't love a 90th minute winner! Great footage from our screen of the scenes at @O2AcademyLeeds Join us for all England games, continuing with @England vs Panama on Sunday!#WeStillBelieve #ComeOnEngland #ThreeLions #ItsComingHome #EnglandTillIDie pic.twitter.com/lPzXrzQiTZ In his post-match interview Kane said he hoped the win had made fans happy “in the pubs”, and multiple videos posted to social media suggested it had. Down the road from Leeds there were also wild celebrations in this bar in Sheffield.

London’s Tottenham Court Road was also a site of celebration after the game, with happy fans obstructing the traffic and flagging down passing cars to join in the celebrations. Absolute scenes on Tottenham Court road imagine we ever won the World Cup. They've been doing this for every car last 15 mins pic.twitter.com/qRJpdUERSN The celebrations in Leeds also spilled noisily out on to the street after the final whistle. HARRY HARRY KANE! HARRY KANE, HARRY HARRY HARRY KANE!!!

Presenter Gary Lineker tweeted that over 21 million people had watched the match - “18.3m peak on your televisions and more than 3m on iPlayer” -making it the most watched TV programme of the year so far, ahead of the Royal Wedding. If England keep progressing in the tournament, we can expect to see further scenes – perhaps a little more vibrant than they appear to have been when England actually won the World Cup in 1966.
