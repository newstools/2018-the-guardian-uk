For most Londoners the tube is an unpleasant hotbed of stress to be avoided whenever possible, but Jess Macdonald captures a different side to the underground. Via her Instagram account, @missunderground, she shows the tube as a system of empty mazes, showcasing the symmetry and lighting of the winding corridors and staircases. “Every station on the underground has a different look and feel. If you take a few seconds to look around at the details in any one of the stations you see a different personality,” she says. “Some stations feel like you are in a space ship while others have colourful tiles.” Macdonald, who has lived in the capital all her life, is able to capture a quieter image of the underground as she waits for the short moments between trains for people to leave the tunnels and escalators. “I sometimes get my shots in the evening after rush hour but I can get them all times of the day. “I get accused of working for TFL, but in reality I am just a girl walking around the tube taking pictures of the architecture and spaces with my smartphone.” Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.
