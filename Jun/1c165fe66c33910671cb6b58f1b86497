Spotify has announced that its “hate conduct” policy will be rolled back after an industry backlash. In May, Spotify announced that certain artists would be removed from their owned and operated playlists based on behavior. Musicians facing potential criminal charges, including R Kelly and rapper XXXTentacion, were affected, and the company came under fire for regulating some artists and not others. In a post published on the Spotify blog, the “vague” language of the initial provision is criticized along with recognition of the concerns of some artists that mistakes made in their youth would then affect their career. “We don’t aim to play judge and jury,” it reads. “We aim to connect artists and fans – and Spotify playlists are a big part of how we do that. Our playlist editors are deeply rooted in their respective cultures, and their decisions focus on what music will positively resonate with their listeners. That can vary greatly from culture to culture, and playlist to playlist. Across all genres, our role is not to regulate artists.” The post echoes comments made by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, who spoke about his misgivings over the initiative at the Recode tech conference. “We rolled this out wrong and we could have done a much better job,” he said. The move comes after representatives for acts including Kendrick Lamar reached out to Ek to express their disappointment with the policy. Spotify initially responded by reinstating music by XXXTentacion on official playlists. The 20-year-old rapper is awaiting trial over charges of aggravated battery against a pregnant woman and witness tampering. “We will continue to seek ways to impact the greater good and further the industry we all care so much about,” the post also reads. “We believe Spotify has an opportunity to help push the broader music community forward through conversation, collaboration and action. We’re committed to working across the artist and advocacy communities to help achieve that.”
