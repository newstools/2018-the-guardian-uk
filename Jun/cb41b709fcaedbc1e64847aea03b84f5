A man has been handed a five-year football banning order after a video surfaced appearing to show England fans singing an antisemitic song and making Sieg Heil gestures at a bar during the World Cup in Russia. Police investigating the clip served three men with notices under the 1989 Football Spectators Act. Michael Herbert, 57, appeared at Leicester magistrates court on Saturday, where he was handed a five-year football banning order, the National Police Chiefs’ Council said. Two other men, aged 52 and 58, appeared at Leeds magistrates court, where the case was adjourned until Tuesday. The Football Association condemned the video, which appeared to show two men giving Nazi salutes in a bar in Volgograd around England’s opening World Cup game against Tunisia. Volgograd, in southern Russia, was formerly known as Stalingrad and was the site of the bloodiest battle of the second world war. Before England travelled to Russia, supporters were warned to be respectful around “sensitive sites” in the city. The FA was working with the police to find those responsible. Another man, Paul Johnson, 25, appeared before Oxford magistrates court on Saturday following a separate incident on a train near Moscow last Sunday.
