Ariana Grande has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the suicide bomb attack on her Manchester Arena concert in May 2017 that killed 22 people. Asked about the disorder in an interview with British Vogue, Grande said: “Yeah, it’s a real thing. I know those families and my fans, and everyone there experienced a tremendous amount of it as well. “It’s hard to talk about because so many people have suffered such severe, tremendous loss … I feel like I shouldn’t even be talking about my own experience – like I shouldn’t even say anything. I don’t think I’ll ever know how to talk about it and not cry.” She also spoke of a longer-term experience with anxiety. “I think a lot of people have anxiety, especially right now … My anxiety has anxiety … I’ve always had anxiety. I’ve never really spoken about it because I thought everyone had it, but when I got home from tour [in September 2017] it was the most severe I think it’s ever been.” Grande recently revealed she had had a worker bee tattooed behind her ear, the Industrial Revolution-era symbol of Manchester that became a symbol of strength and solidarity shared in the wake of the arena attack. Her new album, Sweetener, is due for release this summer.
