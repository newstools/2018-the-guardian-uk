Police in Colombia have launched an investigation into a series of online death threats made against Carlos Sánchez, who was sent off only three minutes into his country’s opening World Cup game. In a chilling reminder of the murder of Andrés Escobar, who was gunned down days after scoring an own goal for Colombia at the 1994 World Cup, several social media users have targeted the former Aston Villa midfielder with vile messages threatening his life. Sánchez, described as “one of Colombia’s most important players” by the manager, José Pékerman, struck out a hand to block Shinji Kagawa’s effort on the line and earn the second fastest red card in World Cup history. Kagawa rolled Japan’s resulting penalty past David Ospina in a nightmare start to Colombia’s campaign. The extra Japanese player ultimately proved crucial as the Blue Samurai went on to record a shock 2-1 win against the Group H favourites. As more than 25,000 disappointed Colombian fans left the Mordovia Arena in Saransk, one Twitter user posted a picture of Sánchez aligned with a photograph of Escobar and the message: “I propose a dream.” Amid the thousands of tweets repudiating the threat, others supported the idea. “If Andrés Escobar was killed for scoring an own goal, then Carlos Sánchez should be murdered and his dead body pissed on,” said one of the replies. The Colombian radio station Blu Radio has confirmed the judicial arm of the Colombian police has assigned a special cybercrime team to investigate. Colombia face Poland in Kazan on Sunday in a must-win tie for both countries. Sánchez, who has 80 caps for his country, will miss the game after picking up a one-match ban.
