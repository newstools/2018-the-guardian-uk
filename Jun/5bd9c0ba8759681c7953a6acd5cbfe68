New Zealand avocado lovers can expect to fork out a little more for their favourite brunch as the price of the fruit hit record highs last month. The average price for a 200g avocado reached NZ$5.06 last month, the highest price for avocados in the country since records began, up 37% from $3.69 in April 2018 and up 50% from $3.38 in May 2017. “Seasonality impacts avocado prices,” prices manager Matthew Haigh said. “Typically, avocado prices peak in July and August, as the main harvest season is from August to March.” According to the New Zealand Avocado Growers Association, harvest volumes in the year to June 2018 were down to about half the previous season’s yield. Statistics New Zealand said the low yield affected the average retail prices of avocados. Prices for Australian avocados have remained stable. A shortage of the fruit over the new year meant customers were forced to pay up to $9 for a single avocado. However, according to Avocados Australia, the average supermarket retail price has now plateaued at between $2 - $2.50. Australia’s avocado industry recently had one of its biggest seasons ever, but the country still imports much of its avocado stock from New Zealand. It is not clear how the disappointing season might affect prices over the water. Statistics New Zealand said that the price of other fruit and vegetables, such as mandarins and broccoli, had dropped in the last month. The price of mandarins was down 35%, kiwifruit down 39% and broccoli down a nutritious 43%.
