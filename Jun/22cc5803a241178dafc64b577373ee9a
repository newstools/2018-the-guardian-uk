Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, want to build a private swimming pool at the presidential summer retreat on the French Riviera. The president, whose tough economic measures and public spending cuts have led to strikes and street protests, and his wife have reportedly commissioned a study looking into the possibility of installing an above-ground pool at the Fort de Brégançon, which lies on a rocky island off the south of France. The study will examine building regulations at the site, which is classified as a historical monument, as well as technical questions. The site, yards from a private beach, is easily accessible to paparazzi long lenses and the prying eyes of holidaymakers. Previous presidents have been captured in their bathing costumes and it is alleged Jacques Chirac was snapped standing naked in front of a bedroom window at the fort. The exact cost of installing a pool has not been determined, but the Élysée has reported that the initial quotes were up to €150,000. The cost is expected to be met from public funds. The Macrons are said to be keen to have the pool ready for this summer. Fort de Brégançon has been the presidential holiday retreat since Charles de Gaulle first stayed there in the 1960s. It is known to require some updating in terms of decoration. Macron has already asked for some refurbishments and maintenance work to be carried out. The president was criticised this month for reportedly ordering 1,200 new porcelain plates for state dinners after existing tableware was said to be showing “signs of wear”. Days earlier he was filmed railing about the “crazy amount of dough” France spends on social benefits, prompting critics to nickname him the “president of the rich”.
