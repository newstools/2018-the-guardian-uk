The UK’s population is rising at its slowest rate for 13 years, according to the first official figures released since the Brexit vote. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there were an estimated 66,040,229 people living in the country at the end of June 2017. It is the first time the population has exceeded 66 million, but the rate of growth has slowed, largely due to a fall in net migration. Today's annual population release shows that the UK's population exceeded 66 million in 2017 https://t.co/t76y0O9tHl pic.twitter.com/ijUB8D7XrK Over the 12 months to the middle of last year, the number of inhabitants increased by 392,000 people (0.6%), the lowest growth rate since mid-2004. In contrast, figures released in 2017 for the period to the middle of the previous year showed an increase of 538,000 people, the sharpest annual population rise since 1948. The ONS identified Brexit as one of the key drivers of the slowdown, with Europeans having been deterred from seeking work in the UK since the EU referendum. Its migration statistics quarterly bulletin for the period said: “The number of people immigrating for a definite job has remained stable, but there has been a 43% decrease in the number of people immigrating to look for work over the last year, especially for EU citizens. “These changes suggest that Brexit is likely to be a factor in people’s decision to move to or from the UK, but decisions to migrate are complex and other factors are also going to be influencing the figures. “The reduction in the number of immigrants is the largest single driver of the lower level of population growth in the year to mid-2017. “However, it is worth noting that immigration in the year to mid-2017 was still 572,000, broadly in line with the average number of immigrants over the last five years (569,000).” Natural change, which is the number of births minus the number of deaths, of 159,800 people accounted for 41% of the overall population increase. Neil Park, the head of the ONS population estimates unit, said: “This is the lowest annual population growth since 2004 due to a fall in net migration, fewer births and more deaths than previously seen.” He said the effect was most pronounced in London and other areas that have experienced high levels of immigration in recent years. A new shortage of workers from European countries is adding to an NHS staffing crisis and problems in industries that rely on migrant labour. The British Summer Fruits trade body said its members were 10% to 15% short of labour and expected to be more than 30% short by autumn. The latest figures also underline the increasingly ageing profile of the UK population. Nearly 12 million UK residents (18.2%) were aged 65 years and over in mid-2017, compared with 18% in mid-2016. The proportion of those aged 65 and over has increased by at least 0.1% every year since mid-2008, the bulletin showed. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank said this would put an increasing strain on public finances, as older people pay less tax and require more services.
