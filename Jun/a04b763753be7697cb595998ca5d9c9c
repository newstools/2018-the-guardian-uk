The assumption that women will become mothers is being tested more than ever. The US birth rate has hit an all-time low, and British women are having fewer children than they have in the last 10 years. If you have decided not to have children, or if you are considering remaining child-free, we would like to hear from you. What factors made you question becoming a parent, or have you always known? Do you feel societal pressure to become a parent, or sense that parents you know are suspicious of your decision? And how is your life different – for better or for worse – than people you know who have had children? Please fill in the form below if you are either unsure whether you want to be a parent, or are voluntarily child-free. We want to follow up on some responses via telephone, to be used in a podcast. Names, identifying factors and voices can all be changed, and we will check with you if you want to remain anonymous. Your responses will only be seen by the Guardian.
