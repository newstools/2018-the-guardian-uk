Donald Glover and Rashida Jones have joined forces to make an “anti-harassment” video for the Time’s Up movement. The animated short film, which is directed by Jones and narrated by Glover, seeks to offer guidance to correct conduct in the workplace for those who have been left “scared, confused, maybe a little angry” by the recent high-profile misconduct allegations made against public figures. “Is the culture shifting under your feet so fast, maybe you can’t make sense of it? Or do you simply not know how to behave at work any more?” asks Glover’s voiceover, which then goes on to answer a series of “frequently asked questions” about workplace sexual harassment. Among the topics tackled are whether it is acceptable to hug or kiss co-workers, or compliment co-workers on their looks. The film also addresses the “confusing” issue of whether it is OK to ask a colleague out on a date, suggesting that viewers consider the “power dynamic” at play before doing so. The film concludes by asking viewers to speak out if they see any inappropriate conduct at work. “The world is changing under your feet, but ultimately for the better,” Glover says. Jones and Glover’s video comes as part of a wider effort by Time’s Up to combat sexual harassment. The movement, which was founded by women in Hollywood at the turn of the year, has carried out a number of high-profile activist events, and has so far raised $20m (£15m) for a legal defence fund to help at-risk women combat sexual misconduct.
