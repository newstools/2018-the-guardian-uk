Officials have released shocking video of an attack on a man lying on the sidewalk in San Francisco, a city that has become an emblem of American’s homelessness crisis. A man wearing a slim fitting suit and black beanie, and carrying a slim black briefcase, is walking on a city sidewalk when he veers off course to approach a person lying down. The assailant then kicks the prone victim twice, apparently in the head, before appearing to say something, then turning and walking away. The San Francisco police department, which released the video on Thursday, is seeking help from the public to identify the suspect in connection with aggravated assault. Officers did not provide any additional information about the attack or the condition of the victim. The attack took place in the city’s Tenderloin, a neighborhood with a high concentration of single-room occupancy hotels and organizations that offer services for the poor and homeless. The neighborhood, like all of San Francisco, has steadily gentrified in recent years, with more tech company offices moving into the area.
