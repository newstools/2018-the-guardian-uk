Liza Minnelli has said it is “100% fiction” that she approves of the forthcoming Renée Zellweger biopic of her mother, Judy Garland. In a post on Facebook responding to a report that she had “bonded” with Zellweger over the latter’s portrayal of Garland in the Rupert Goold-directed feature film, Minnelli wrote: “I have never met nor spoken to Renée Zellweger … I don’t know how these stories get started, but I do not approve nor sanction the upcoming film about Judy Garland in any way.” She added: “Any reports to the contrary are 100% fiction.” The film, titled Judy, is a British production part financed by BBC Films, which wil focus on Garland’s run of appearances at the Talk of the Town nightclub in London in 1969, a few months before her death in June that year, which was ascribed to an accidental overdose of barbiturates. Minnelli was born in 1946, the daughter of Garland and her second husband, the director Vincente Minnelli.
