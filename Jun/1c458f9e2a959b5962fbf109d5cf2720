David Lynch has released a statement addressed to Donald Trump, urging him to rethink the way he is leading America. In an interview with the Guardian, published on 23 June, the film-maker said that Trump “could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much”. Lynch also said that no one is able to counter Trump “in an intelligent way” while stating that he was “not really a political person”. The initial quote was picked up by Breitbart News and tweeted by Trump who then mentioned Lynch at a rally in South Carolina, saying the director’s career in Hollywood would be “over” for what he perceived as support. Lynch, who originally supported Bernie Sanders in the primaries and then Gary Johnson in the election, has now released a statement on Facebook to address any confusion. “I wish you and I could sit down and have a talk,” he writes. “This quote which has traveled around was taken a bit out of context and would need some explaining.” He continues: “Unfortunately, if you continue as you have been, you will not have a chance to go down in history as a great president. This would be very sad it seems for you – and for the country. You are causing suffering and division.” Lynch finally made a plea for Trump to rethink his agenda. “It’s not too late to turn the ship around,” he writes. “Point our ship toward a bright future for all. You can unite the country. Your soul will sing. Under great loving leadership, no one loses – everybody wins. It’s something I hope you think about and take to heart. All you need to do is treat all the people as you would like to be treated.” Lynch’s most recent screen credit was the much-acclaimed return to his most famous work, Twin Peaks: The Return, which aired in 2017. His new book Room to Dream, co-authored by Kristine McKenna, was released earlier this month.
