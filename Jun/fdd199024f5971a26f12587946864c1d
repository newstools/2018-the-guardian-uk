Marcus Rashford will be examined by England’s medical staff on Wednesday to assess whether there are any doubts about his involvement in the team’s opening game of the World Cup finals, against Tunisia. Rashford hurt a knee during a training game at St George’s Park on Tuesday and the Manchester United striker was still complaining about soreness when the squad arrived in Repino, outside St Petersburg, for their first look at the training base for the tournament. Gareth Southgate’s players are due to have their first training session at Zelenogorsk, a village six miles away, on Thursday but Rashford’s involvement is uncertain, with the priority being to make sure there is no serious risk of him missing England’s opening game of Group G in Volgograd on Monday. “Marcus took a slight knock, but nothing too serious,” the manager said. “We’ll look at that ahead of tomorrow’s session.” England have an injury-free squad otherwise and before the flight to St Petersburg two of their 11 black or mixed‑race players – the highest number the nation has taken to a major tournament – tried to play down fears that the competition might be tarnished by racism. Danny Rose had revealed last week that he had asked his family to stay at home because he felt the risk was too significant, but the Tottenham defender appears to be the only member of the squad who has taken that course of action. “I’ve got no concerns at all,” said Ashley Young, Rose’s competitor for the left wing-back position. “I’ve got a family that is going. The FA have spoken to us security-wise and I’ve every confidence in them.” Danny Welbeck delivered a similar message, noting that he had been to Russia without any problems when Arsenal played CSKA Moscow in the Europa League towards the end of last season. Welbeck said: “I am looking forward to it. I went there a couple of months ago with Arsenal and things were fine. There were no troubles or worries whatsoever … I can’t wait to get back there.”
