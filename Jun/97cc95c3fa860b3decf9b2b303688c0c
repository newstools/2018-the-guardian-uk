Rapper XXXTentacion has been shot dead in Florida, authorities say. The 20-year-old Floridian, whose real name is Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, was shopping for motorcycles when a gunman reportedly ran up to his vehicle and shot him, according to TMZ. His death was confirmed by the Broward sheriff’s office. In a statement, detectives said the rapper was approached by two armed suspects shortly before 4pm. “At least one of the suspects fired a gun striking Onfroy ... Both suspects fled in a dark color SUV. Investigators say it appears to be a possible robbery.” XXXTentacion’s most recent album, entitled ?, was a No 1 hit in the US this year and included the hits Sad! and Changes. His albums have so far sold over 2m units in the US. His music had briefly been taken off Spotify’s official playlists under the service’s “hateful conduct” policy in response to allegations that he attacked his girlfriend while she was pregnant. He was awaiting trial for that and other charges, including witness tampering. Onfroy has experienced legal troubles since the age of 16, when he was sent to a youth detention center for gun possession charges. In 2016, he was arrested and charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. After being arrested again for aggravated battery of his pregnant girlfriend, he donated $100,000 to domestic violence prevention programs and announced an event to support rape victims. Last year, he was attacked and blamed the rap trio Migos yet later apologized after security footage showed them not to be involved. In an interview earlier this month with the Miami New Times, he talked about his history of violence which started in the classroom, where he attacked students in order to get his mother to pay him attention. “I used to beat kids at school just to get her to talk to me, yell at me,” he said.
