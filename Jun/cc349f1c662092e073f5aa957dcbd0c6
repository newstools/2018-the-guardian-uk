On the 8 June 1968, three days after he was assassinated in Los Angeles, Robert Kennedy’s funeral took place at St Patrick’s Cathedral, New York. His body had been returned from California because he represented New York in the Senate; after the service, his coffin was loaded on to a train and taken to Washington for burial. Paul Fusco travelled on board, assigned to photograph the interment at Arlington National Cemetery. He found, however, that the cortege had an unexpected audience: as the train slowly travelled for eight hours through derelict New Jersey or ragged rural Delaware, a million locals turned out to watch this rite of passage. Fusco’s documentation had to be snatched from a jerky railway carriage, with his camera awkwardly aimed westward into the glare of the declining sun. But his impromptu images add up to a conspectus of America, its people united – in a way that is nowadays inconceivable – by a shared emotion. Boys dripping in their swimming trunks stiffly saluted; bridesmaids tossed bouquets; African Americans sank to their knees and sobbed. In Philadelphia, 20,000 bereft citizens crammed into the station and sang the Battle Hymn of the Republic. By the time the train crossed Baltimore, where Fusco took this photograph, the mood had altered. Here the crowds in their summer clothes are waving, and children perched on immobilised police cars merrily grin. A teenager has stopped twirling her candy-coloured hula hoop, but not for long. Constitutionally pledged to pursue happiness, Americans prefer festivity to mourning; if the train had made a detour to New Orleans, there would have been a jazz band in the jiving streets. Even before Kennedy was in the ground, recovery had begun, and a political martyr was enjoying the very different afterlife of a celebrity.
