Vincent Kompany has been included in Belgium’s 23-man World Cup squad despite picking up a groin injury during a friendly on Saturday. The veteran defender walked off the field early in the second half of Belgium’s 0-0 draw with Portugal without waiting to be substituted. Belgium coach Roberto Martínez said Kompany felt discomfort in his groin after overstretching in a challenge. Martínez also named Los Angeles FC defender Laurent Ciman as a reserve in case Kompany’s injury proves too serious for him to play in Russia. Martínez said he will wait until the eve of Belgium’s opening World Cup match, against Panama on 18 June, before making a final decision on Kompany’s fitness.

Then we will get a good opportunity to make a diagnosis. “Vincent Kompany is a true leader. He performed in a fantastic manner when he was on the pitch. His leadership is essential for us.” Former Manchester United forward Adnan Januzaj was a surprise inclusion, while Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke was one of five players to miss out, as well as goalkeeper Matz Sels, Watford’s Christian Kabasele and Jordan Lukaku. Belgium are in Group G in the World Cup where they will also face England and Tunisia. Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has been named in Egypt’s World Cup squad despite being injured in the Champions League final. Salah, 25, will not meet up with his team-mates until 9 June as he continues his recovery from a shoulder injury, his national team said.

Peña was forced to make way for captain Paolo Guerrero, who has been freed to take part at the tournament after the Swiss Federal Tribunal agreed to temporarily lift a 14-month doping ban pending an appeal. Guerrero, who tested positive for a cocaine byproduct contained in a tea and which he said he ingested unknowingly, was freed to take part on Thursday and scored twice in the 3-0 win over Saudi Arabia on Sunday.
