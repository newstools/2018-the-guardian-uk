West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini has thanked police in Chile for their quick response after he and his wife were reportedly mugged at gunpoint. The incident occurred in the Santiago suburb of Vitacura on Saturday night as the couple headed to a restaurant for a meal. Pellegrini’s wife, Carola Pucci, is reported to have had her handbag stolen before the robbers were confronted by police. The assailants fled in a stolen car, which was later found abandoned, according to reports in Chile. Pellegrini wrote on Twitter: “Congratulations to @Carabdechile for their speedy and brave reaction. I’m also thankful for the help of locals. I hope they give the Carabineros more resources to solve the problem of delinquency as soon as possible.” A spokesman for West Ham said: “Our Joint-Chairman David Sullivan has been in touch with Manuel Pellegrini to offer our good wishes and support. We are relieved to hear that Manuel and his wife were both unharmed.” Pellegrini signed a three-year deal as West Ham’s new manager last month. Russian police say former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Nwankwo Kanu had $11,000 stolen from his luggage when he flew in for the World Cup. State news agency Tass reports that Kanu flew in from London through Moscow and on to Kaliningrad, where Nigeria face Croatia in their opening World Cup match on 16 June. When he arrived, he found the cash missing from his luggage. Police spokeswoman Irina Volk says two baggage handlers at Sheremetevo airport in Moscow have been detained on suspicion of theft.
