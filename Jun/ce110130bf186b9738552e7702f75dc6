Hadley says: The rap battle New York has been waiting for. Best lyric: “Yes, some of my lyrics are sexist / But you bitches and hoes should know / I’m trying to correct this.” Hadley says: Jemaine pulls out some Prince in his inept attempt to chat up a woman. Best lyric: “You’re so beautiful you could be a part-time model / But you’d probably still have to keep your normal job.” Hadley says: The only Paul Simon satire you need, but also a great song in its own right, in which Jemaine remembers his ex-girlfriends and his ex-girlfriends respond. And the video was directed by Michel Gondry to boot! Best lyric: “Mona, you told me you were in a coma / Tiffany, you said that you had an epiphany / Mm-hmm.” Hadley says: One of the many Conchords parodies that is better than the original. The smoooothest 70s sexytime jams. Best lyric: “Caribbean / Parisian / Bolivian / Namibian / East Indochinian / Republic of Dominican / Amphibian / Presbyterian / Outta sight / Amazin’ ladies.” Hadley says: In which they manage to do the whole of Bowie’s back catalogue in three minutes. Flat-out genius. Best lyric: “Do you have one really funky sequined space suit, Bowie, or do you have ch-changes?”
