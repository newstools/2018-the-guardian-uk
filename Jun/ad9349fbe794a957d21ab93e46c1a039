Andy Murray said on Tuesday he still hopes to play at Wimbledon after a year out nursing his chronic hip injury, but he knows better than anyone that time is running out. He was still on the entry list on Tuesday afternoon for the Rosmalen grass tournament in Holland which starts on Monday, but the former world No 1 confirmed in a sponsored interview in London that he has had serious issues with his rehabilitation after a hip operation in Melbourne in January. “It’s been very slow,” Murray said of his recovery. “I’ve been out getting close to a year now which is a lot longer than I think me or any of my team expected at the beginning. But I’m getting closer to playing again. I’ve started training a few days ago and hoping to make my comeback during the grass court season. “I’m hoping I will be there [in contention at Wimbledon] but Roger Federer has obviously got a phenomenal record on grass. He’s won eight times at Wimbledon so he’ll definitely up there as one of the favourites. But you never know, it depends a little bit on the draw.” Murray resumed hitting on court in April but stopped after a handful of sessions, clearly not happy that his hip was standing up to the pressure of competing for points. His mother, Judy, revealed this week that he had gone back on court, and the player confirmed that on Tuesday, sounding a little more upbeat than he has for some time. He was desperate to return to the tour at the start of the year and took most of his team to the Brisbane Open in January before pulling out at the last minute. Then he made a quick detour to Melbourne, not to play in the Australian Open but to undergo surgery with John O’Donnell, a respected hip surgeon he has known for 10 years. Since then he has made meticulous efforts to get back to match condition and has been adamant he would not return until he was, “100% fit”. If he has doubts still, there is precious little time to eradicate them before Wimbledon, which starts on 2 July.
