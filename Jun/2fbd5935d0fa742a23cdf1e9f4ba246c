Whisk together the following ingredients: an egg yolk, 1 tbsp each of smooth and grainy mustard, 3 tbsp olive oil and a little salt. Chop 4 or 5 bushy sprigs of dill – enough to give you 2 heaped tbsp – then stir them into the dressing with 1 tbsp of liquid honey and 2 tsp of capers. Halve and stone 300g of cherries and add them to the dressing. Wash and shake dry 40g of wild rocket, 25g of lamb’s lettuce and a generous handful of whole, small parsley leaves. Tear about 350g of boiled ham into thick chunks, then toss it with the cherries and the mustard dressing. Pile the salad leaves and herbs on to plates then add the ham and cherries and their dressing. Enough for 2. Don’t be tempted to cut the ham into cubes. Jagged pieces pulled naturally from the joint are far more pleasing to eat. If possible, use the ham warm from its stock, when it is at its most succulent. If you have time on your hands, it is worth letting the ham sit in the dressing for 20 minutes or so. This is wonderful with freshly cooked ham, torn apart while still warm. You can buy a small piece of ham for 2 people, boil it and let it cool slightly in its cooking water (onion, peppercorns, bay leaves, cloves… you know the drill). Tear the meat into thick strips and toss with the cherries and mustard dressing and eat immediately. This is good, too, with ripe apricots instead of the cherries.
