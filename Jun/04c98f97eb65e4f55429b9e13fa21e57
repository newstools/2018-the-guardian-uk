Tickets for six of the eight round of 16 games are still available to varying degrees on the Fifa late availability website. There is still high availability for France v Argentina in Kazan on Saturday, which might be useful for those fans already in Russia. Yes, the FA has sold only 1,500 of their 3,500 allocation for Tuesdayâ€™s match. Having said this, Fifa has sold out of tickets for this match and the Brazil v Mexico knockout game. The best way is through the official England Supporters Travel Club. This is one of the worst-attended major tournaments in recent times with England not even filling their modest allocation for the Tunisia and Panama group games. But people are starting to get more interested with the team performing better than expected. Yes. If the FA sells out its allocation for the Colombia game or any future England games at Russia 2018 those fans who regularly follow England abroad will be given priority. Not if you have a ticket. With every ticket you get a Fan ID, which allows visa-free travel. You still need to give detailed information which is stored by the Russian authorities but it is not as complicated as getting a visa which requires a trip to the Russian embassy. That is unclear. Asked yesterday, Fifa simply said it was subject to data protection. Almost certainly because of the wait time for a standard visa but the Football Supporters Federation have devised a way round this issue. They discovered you can get multiple Fan IDs with the same ticket reference number, allowing you visa-free travel without buying a ticket. There are fanzones around Moscow with big screens to watch the game and where beer and food is relatively cheap.
