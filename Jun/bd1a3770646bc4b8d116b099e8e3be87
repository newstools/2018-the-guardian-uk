Andy Murray decided at the last minute on Saturday morning to make his comeback at Queen’s Club this week, ending a year of pain, indecision and concern about his future. The former world No1 and five-times Queen’s champion will play his first competitive match since Sam Querrey beat him in the Wimbledon quarter-finals last July – and he has been drawn against Nick Kyrgios in the first round. He went away from the All-England Club nursing a long-term injury to his left hip that forced him to withdraw from the 2017 US Open and the Brisbane Open over the new year, before having hip surgery in Melbourne on 8 January that forced his withdrawal from the Australian Open. Murray has worked hard since then to repair the damage and his dormant game, even getting ahead of his own timetable before suffering a setback in April. Murray put his name down for a hard court tournament in Washington DC in August – which he might yet play in – then made a tentative commitment to appear in a grass court event in Rosmalen this week, before again pulling out at the last minute. When he arrived at Queen’s on Friday to hit with the British No2, Cameron Norrie, he looked content but distant, refusing to acknowledge the small clutch of tennis writers who were allowed to gather on the edge of an outside court to watch them hit for half an hour. Norrie won the first set 6-3, Murray the second 7-5– which was enough to convince him he could at least be competitive in a best-of-three match at these renamed Fever Tree Championships. However, he will have to stress-test himself in proper competition here to be sure he can survive the rigours of best-of-five matches at Wimbledon, which starts on 2 July – especially as he will be unseeded and could easily draw one of the favourites in the first round.
