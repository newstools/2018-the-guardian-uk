Arsenal have confirmed a deal to sign the goalkeeper Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen, believed to be for an initial €22m (£19.2m). The 26-year-old, who was part of the Germany squad that won the Confederations Cup last year but was not selected for this summer’s World Cup, is believed to have agreed a five-year deal at the Emirates after he was identified as the long-term successor to Petr Cech. Leno was an integral part of the Leverkusen side which finished fifth in the Bundesliga last season, having begun his career at Stuttgart, and it is understood that Arsenal could pay up to another £3m in bonuses as part of the deal. Both clubs confirmed the deal on Tuesday night. “We are very pleased that Bernd Leno will be joining us,” said Arsenal’s head coach, Unai Emery. “Bernd is a goalkeeper of high quality and experience. We are all excited that Bernd has chosen Arsenal and look forward to start working with him in pre-season.” The arrival casts doubt over the future of Cech, who has only one year remaining on the contract he signed when he moved from Chelsea in 2015. Arsenal are also closing in on the signing of the Uruguay midfielder Lucas Torreira of Sampdoria for £25m and the Greece defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund for around £16m as Emery continues his rebuilding job. The Switzerland full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner joined on a free transfer from Juventus this month.
