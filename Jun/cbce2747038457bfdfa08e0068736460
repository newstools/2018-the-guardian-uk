Manchester City winger Leroy Sané has been omitted from Germany’s final 23-man World Cup squad, the German federation has confirmed on its Twitter account. Sané, who won the PFA young player of year award after helping City to the Premier League title, missed out to Julian Brandt of Bayer Leverkusen, while manager Joachim Löw also opted to cut Bernd Leno, Jonathan Tah and Nils Petersen from his squad.

We have good players on the wing in Thomas Müller and Marco Reus. Julian Draxler played a good Confed Cup, and made progress there. It was a tight race between Leroy Sané and Julian Brandt. Both have big qualities, both are good in the one-on-one duels. “Julian Brandt was at the Confed Cup, had some strong games there, and put in good shifts in the training camp too. Leroy Sane is a huge talent, no doubt, and he will be back with the team in September.” Sane has so far won 12 caps for Germany, but he has yet to find the back of the net for his national team. He has also only set up one goal. “Maybe he has not fully arrived in the national team games. Maybe that tipped the balance,” said Löw. “He did a good job against Austria, tried to work in defence, went into the transition play. No blame here. And his behaviour off the pitch was good as well.” There were places for Sané’s City team-mate Ilkay Gündogan, Arsenal’s Mesut Özil and Chelsea’s Antonio Rüdiger, as well as goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who has been appointed team captain despite his long recovering from injury. Germany begin their World Cup finals campaign against Mexico on 17 June and also face Sweden and South Korea in Group F.
