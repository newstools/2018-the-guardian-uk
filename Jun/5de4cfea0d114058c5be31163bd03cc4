Two reports published by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee have found British intelligence agencies were involved in the torture and kidnap of terrorism suspects after 9/11. Here are the key details from the reports: • On 232 occasions UK intelligence officers were found to have continued supplying questions to foreign agencies between 2001 and 2010, despite knowing or suspecting a prisoner was being tortured or mistreated. • On 198 occasions, UK intelligence officers received information from a prisoner they knew was being mistreated. • In a further 128 cases, foreign intelligence bodies told UK intelligence agencies prisoners were being mistreated. • MI5 or MI6 offered to help fund at least three rendition operations. • The agencies planned or agreed to a further 28 rendition operations. • They provided intelligence to assist with a further 22 rendition operations. • Two MI6 officers consented to mistreatment meted out by others. Only one of these incidents has been investigated by police. • In a further 13 cases, UK intelligence officers witnessed an individual being tortured or mistreated. • MI5, MI6 and the military conducted up to 3,000 interviews of prisoners held at Guantánamo. • No attempt is being made to find out whether guidelines introduced by the coalition government in 2010 are helping to prevent the UK’s intelligence agencies from continuing to be involved in human rights abuses. • The UK breached its commitment to the international prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. • On at least two occasions ministers made “inappropriate” decisions. • Jack Straw authorised payment of “a large share of the costs” of the rendition of two people in October 2004. • A further Scotland Yard investigation must be considered.
