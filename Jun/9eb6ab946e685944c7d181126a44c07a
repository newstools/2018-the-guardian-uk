Moeen Ali has promised to remain a free spirit with the bat during England’s series with Australia and the all-rounder has no regrets about the shot that caused his demise against Scotland. Moeen looked to have steered Eoin Morgan’s side to their target of 372 at the Grange on Sunday, only to pick out long-on when attempting to hit the left-arm spinner Mark Watt over the rope going for a fourth six in his innings of 46 from No 7. Scotland went on to a famous six-run victory, but Moeen will continue to play his way and is feeling in form after hitting 114 from 75 balls for Worcestershire against Warwickshire in the Royal London Cup last week. “When shots are going for six and you’re playing well, everyone is trying to big you up,” he said. “Mis‑hit one, get out, all the negative people come out. I’m going to keep enjoying how I bat, I feel like I’ve found a bit of rhythm. “In an ideal world, you knock the runs off and win the game. The ball was there and I just mis‑hit it. From my point of view it’s best not to have any doubt. I will stay true to myself.” The one-day series with Australia could at some stage pit Moeen against Nathan Lyon, who removed him seven times in 10 innings during the Ashes. The Cricket Australia website recently ran a feature entitled “How Lyon made Moeen his bunny” in which the off-spinner detailed how inside information from Moeen’s Worcestershire team‑mates Brett D’Oliveira and Ben Cox helped him to set plans. Moeen’s response? “If you look at a few of my dismissals, you’d probably know that anyway. It doesn’t take Einstein to work that out. He bowled really well, got me out a few times. But you don’t get medals for getting guys out all the time. Who cares? I found him difficult in Australia but one-day cricket is different. And I’m in a different mindset to what I was then.”
