Aaron Rodgers has delivered a sharp rebuke to his young wide receivers as the NFL pre-season cranks into gear. The Green Bay Packers quarterback, regarded as one of the best players in the league, was frustrated at what he believed was the lack of effort among some younger players as they prepared for their game against the Tennessee Titans on Thursday. “It was one of the worst cards sessions we’ve had,” Rodgers said, referring to exercises in which players run exercises written down by coaches. “I don’t know how you can make it any simpler. You literally have what the play would be in our terminology on the card, and the effort level was very low, especially with what I’m accustomed to. I’ve been running that period for a number of years. So it’s not a good start for us on the card period for the young guys. I think [DeAngelo] Yancey has really progressed, G-Mo [Geronimo Allison]. Obviously, 16 [Jake Kumerow]. But everybody else was kind of piss poor.” Rodgers did not praise three of the receivers drafted by the Packers in this year’s draft – J’Mon Moore, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St. Brown – suggesting he was not happy with their efforts. Rodgers will turn 35 in December, and has appeared in just one Super Bowl, a disappointing return for a player of his talents. “I’m getting older and grumpier. I’ve been at this for a long time,” said Rodgers. “I’m tired too, we’re all a little tired. When you get a little tired, the fuse gets a little shorter.” The Packers offensive coordinator, Joe Philbin, said he had no problems with Rodgers’s blunt words. “Certainly Aaron, his comments, his example, his leadership has a profound effect on the ballclub, the offense in particular and the whole team in general,” Philbin said. “His words are meaningful.” The Packers are 14-1 to win the Super Bowl this season, with the New England Patriots the favourites with the bookies at 6-1.
