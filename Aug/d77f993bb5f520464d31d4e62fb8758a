Soft Cell have released their first new song in 15 years, Northern Lights. The catchy synthpop track – described by the band’s singer, Marc Almond, as “a celebration of our roots in northern soul” – comes as the duo get ready for a farewell concert at the O2 Arena, London, on 30 September. The pair had huge success in the 1980s with another take on northern soul, their cover of the 1964 Gloria Jones song Tainted Love. Almond’s bandmate, the producer Dave Ball, said the genre “played such a great part in our formative years and was a huge influence on our music”. Northern Lights is released at midnight on Wednesday 22 August, but before that, is streaming exclusively here. The lyrics to Northern Lights reference two northern soul clubs from the late 60s and early 70s, Golden Torch in Stoke-on-Trent and Twisted Wheel in Manchester. Soft Cell had 10 top 10 hits in the UK, including Say Hello, Wave Goodbye and Torch, but split in 1984 amid drug problems. However, relations never truly soured, and the pair reconvened for the 2002 album Cruelty Without Beauty. In the past 34 years, Almond has released 23 solo albums and performed in several theatrical productions. Ball has been less successful, though in 1994 he had a top three hit in the UK with his dance music group the Grid. Northern Lights, along with another new track, Guilty (Cos I Say You Are), will be on the band’s compilation album, The Singles – Keychains and Snowstorms, released on 28 September.
