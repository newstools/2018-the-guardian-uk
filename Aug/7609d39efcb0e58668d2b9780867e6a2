I am a 36-year-old married woman and recently found out my husband was cheating on me. He says there was no sex involved, but he was very close to another woman for a couple of weeks. I have decided to try to work it out with him. We have had sex twice since I learned about the affair, but I cannot make him achieve orgasm, which makes me feel awful as a wife and as a woman. Is this psychological on his part or is he still being naughty – or am I overthinking everything? He says he doesn’t know the cause, but that it’s not me. Try to believe him. Male orgasm can be elusive and occasionally mysterious – even to the owner of the penis. He probably has feelings such as guilt, confusion and anxiety that may be affecting his ability to ejaculate. Each partner’s sexual response is connected to the overall couple connection – which in your case has been seriously damaged. However, if you are truly committed to each other, your erotic connection will slowly improve. Accept that you are not to blame – and don’t imagine that he is no longer attracted to you. People have affairs for all kinds of reasons, many of them nothing to do with sex. But the loss of trust between a couple after the discovery of an affair can take some time to repair. During the recovery period, it is normal that your sexual connection will be affected or even lost. Understandably, your feelings of betrayal and disappointment will be playing a part. Try to be patient. Focus on trying to have some relaxed leisure time – even fun – together and, for now, avoid attributing too much meaning to the quality of your love-making. •Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. •If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).
