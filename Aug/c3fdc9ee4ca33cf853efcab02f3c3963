On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed Rudy Giuliani’s appearance on Meet the Press this weekend, where Donald Trump’s defense attorney put forth a bizarre defense against accusations of collusion with Russia. “We begin this evening with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s lawyer and a one-man legal improv troupe,” began Oliver. “Giuliani was on TV this morning to talk about the ongoing Mueller investigation and he came up with a rationale for his boss’ refusal to sit down with Mueller that was, even by Giuliani standards, very Giuliani.” In an interview with Chuck Todd, the host suggested Trump doesn’t need to worry about perjuring himself in a meeting with Mueller as long as he tells the truth. “That’s so silly,” responded Giuliani, saying it is “somebody’s version of the truth” before adding: “Truth isn’t truth.” “You just said truth isn’t truth,” Oliver replied. “That is not acceptable from the president’s lawyers. It’s barely acceptable from a sophomore philosophy major who just tried molly for the first time.” “In fairness to Giuliani, the Ken Bone of 9/11, that was not the dumbest thing he said in that interview,” Oliver continued. “Just watch Giuliani, the president’s lawyer whose job is to essentially try and dismiss potentially damning evidence like the Trump Tower meeting, basically do the exact opposite.” In another clip from the interview, Giuliani argues the Trump Tower meeting is not worth investigating before saying it was “for the purpose of getting information about Clinton”. When the host points out the contradiction, Giuliani attempts to walk back his statement on the meeting’s intent. Oliver replied: “What is Giuliani doing and why does the White House keep letting him go on TV?” “At this rate,” he continued, “Trump is going to wind up behind bars with Giuliani visiting him, saying: ‘Don’t worry, Donald. Prison isn’t prison.’”
