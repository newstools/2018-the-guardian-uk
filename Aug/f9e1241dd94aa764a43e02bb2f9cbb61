A rare treat, or perhaps a letdown, awaits online chess viewers this weekend when the $300,000 (£233,000) Sinquefield Cup at St Louis reaches its decisive closing rounds. Saturday’s seventh-round pairings are headed by Magnus Carlsen (Norway) v Fabiano Caruana (US), world champion v title challenger in their final encounter before their €1m 12-game series starts in London at The College, Southampton Row, on 9 November. Sunday’s eighth round features Shakhriyar Mamedyarov v Carlsen, world No 3 against world No 1. The Azeri 33-year-old is one of a rare breed of elite players who have improved significantly after the age of 30. His surge began just over a year ago, sparked by a recipe of more work on openings, controlling his formerly over-exuberant tactics, and giving up drinking. The English GM Simon Williams has popularised advancing ‘Harry the h pawn’ as an attacking tactic in a variety of situations. For ‘Shak’, it is ‘Gary the g pawn’ which he uses to ginger up quiet positions. He began a key game in the blitz at St Louis with the calm 1 Nf3 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 e3 d5 4 b3 Be7 5 Bb2 dxc4 8 Bxc4 c5 7 Nc3 b6 but then stirred it up with 8 g2-g4!? Why the risk of a viewing letdown? After five of the nine Sinquefield rounds there was a bizarre leaderboard with five of the 10 GMs, including Carlsen, Caruana and Mamedyarov, on 3/5. The tournament has the stiffest possible anti-draw rules; no draws except by threefold repetition, the 50-move rule, or the arbiter’s blessing in a barren position. Yet 80% of the games have been halved. Carlsen has been trying to win his Whites, but he will want to hide any openings prepared for the world title match, while tomorrow’s game may depend on Mamedyarov and whether he is ready to take risks. Both could be routine draws, but tune in and judge for yourself. The website chess24.com is best for viewing. This game from the Abu Dhabi Masters helped Nihal Sarin become the 12th youngest GM in chess history at 14 years and one month. India now has three of this top 12, following Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa (second) and Parimarjan Negi (fourth). China (Bu Xiangzhi and Wei Yi) is the only other country with more than one. What is the secret? There are many answers, but a special type of memory clearly helps. Carlsen knew all the countries of the world plus their capitals and flags at age five, and apparently Sarin could perform the same feat even younger. Sarin’s Australian IM opponent goes for sharp play, but overdoes it with 12 Ne4? (12 a4), 15 f5? (15 Nxe5) and 16 f6? (16 Nxe5). He gets another chance to stay in the game after 17…Bf5? (Nd7! 18 fxg7 Bb7) but fluffs it by 18 Re1? (18 Qg5!). The outcome is the elegant finish Qg6! and Nb4! when White has no defence to Black’s several threats.
