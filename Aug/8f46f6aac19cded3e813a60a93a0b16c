Heavyweight boxer Curtis Harper lost his bout against Efe Ajagba on Friday in Minnesota in unusual fashion - leaving the ring after the opening bell without a punch being thrown. Fighting on the Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) card at the Minneapolis Armory, Harper ducked through the ropes as soon as the bell rang and walked all the way back to his dressing room. He did not return and was eventually disqualified. According to PBC commentator Jordan Hardy, Harper’s gesture was in protest over the amount of money he was due to receive for fighting Nigeria’s Ajagba, who improved his record to 7-0 with his one-second win. Hardy claimed to have spoken to Harper, who has not commented publicly on his early exit, after the incident. “He’s not getting paid enough to fight and he wants respect,” Hardy said. Harper’s trainer, the former lightweight champion Nate Campbell, wrote on social media that he was “embarrassed” by Harper’s actions, accusing the 30-year-old of “disrespecting himself, his wife the fans and me.” Ajagba’s camp tried to put a different spin on things. “No punch necessary. One look and the opponent runs, runs out of the ring,” Ajagba’s promoter told ESPN. “He defined what the most feared man in boxing means.”
