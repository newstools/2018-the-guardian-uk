A livestreamed conversation with Jason Kessler, a white supremacist rally organizer, was interrupted when Kessler’s father admonished the 35-year-old on video, and told him to get out of his room. Kessler was one of the main organizers of last year’s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed when a self-described Nazi drove his car into a crowd of protesters. In the video, he was in conversation with Patrick Little, a neo-Nazi who ran as a Republican for the US Senate in California this year. Little’s platform included calling for the United States to be “free from Jews”. Kessler and Little were deep in conversation about Orthodox Jews, when Kessler’s father cut in. “Hey!” Kessler’s father can be heard to yell. “You get out of my room!” “You got a drunk roommate there?” Little asked. “Something like that,” Kessler responded. His dad then cuts in, saying: “I want this to stop in my room, Jason, this is my room.” Unite the Right 2 organizer, Nazi failure Jason Kessler gets yelled at by his dad for being a Nazi while livestreaming w Nazi loser Patrick Little, who admits he may have to sell the boat he's broadcasting from at a loss because he needs money. pic.twitter.com/skmlmtdSAE Kessler explains to Little that legal costs associated with last year’s Unite the Right rally meant that he had to move back in with his parents. These new living arrangements appear to be somewhat fraught. Kessler complains that his parents watch “constant anti-German propaganda” on the History Channel. He also describes them as “cucked”, a derogatory term popular with angry young men on the far right. The video of Kessler and Little speaking has reportedly been online for a few weeks, but only gained widespread attention on Wednesday. It is the latest humiliation for Kessler, who organized a Unite the Right 2 rally in Washington DC earlier this month, as a follow-up to last year’s violent demonstrations in Charlottesville. Kessler applied for a permit for about 400 people but only about 20 white supremacists turned up. They were far outnumbered by more than 1,000 counter-protesters. Kessler can at least take some solace in the fact that he is not the only member of the right to have recently had a public dressing-down by a family member. On Monday, David Glosser, the uncle of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, published an essay in Politico calling his nephew a hypocrite. “I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, who is an educated man and well aware of his [Jewish] heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country,” Glosser wrote. Glosser told the Guardian that while his essay was likely to “raise hard feelings” in the family, “in the face of the virtual kidnapping of thousands of innocent children, I didn’t feel I had the ethical standing to remain silent”.
