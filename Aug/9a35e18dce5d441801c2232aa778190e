At least four people have been killed in a shooting in the eastern Canadian city of Fredericton. Police described the incident as “active” and asked residents to avoid the area and stay in their homes. They also asked social media users to refrain from detailing the position or activities of police or first responders online. The circumstances of the shooting remain unclear. Police said on Friday morning that they had taken one suspect into custody and noted that the investigation was ongoing. Resident David MacCoubrey told the Canadian Press that he woke up at 7am to the sound of three gunshots, which sounded as if they were being fired 10 meters from his bed. During the next 90 minutes or so, he heard more than 15 other gunshots. The gunfire appeared to be coming from the middle of his apartment complex, which consists of four buildings that sit in a square, he said. In 2014, three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers were killed and two others wounded in another mass shooting in the small east coast province. More details soon …
