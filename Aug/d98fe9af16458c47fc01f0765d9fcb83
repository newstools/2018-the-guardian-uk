Virat Kohli has poured scorn on the ECB’s new 100-ball format called The Hundred, saying he does not want to be part of an experiment. The India captain said commercialism “is taking over the real quality of cricket” and as a Test player he would not join the England and Wales Cricket Board’s city-based competition when it launches in 2020, adding: “I cannot think of one more format.” Kohli is not convinced the ECB’s innovations, including five-ball overs bowled in pairs before changing ends each 10 deliveries, will lure a new generation of fans. In an interview with Wisden Cricket Monthly, Kohli said: “Obviously for the people involved in the whole process and the set-up it will be really exciting but I cannot think of one more format, to be honest. “I’m already very … I wouldn’t say frustrated but sometimes it can get very demanding of you when you have to play so much cricket regularly. I feel somewhere the commercial aspect is taking over the real quality of cricket and that hurts me. “I don’t want to be a testing sort of a cricketer for any new format. I don’t want to be someone who’s going to be part of that World XI who comes and launches the 100-ball format. “I love playing the IPL, I love watching the BBL, because you’re working towards something, competing against high-quality sides and it gets your competitive juices flowing. That’s what you want as a cricketer. I’m all for the leagues but not to experiment.” Kohli, though, still wants to play in the County Championship. A neck injury prevented him playing for Surrey before India’s tour. “County cricket always intrigued me. Unfortunately it couldn’t happen this time but I would love to come again. I’ve heard so much from so many players over so many years that it has really helped them understand their games even better. Also just to understand how professional the set-up over here is, how the longest format of the game is looked at with so much respect.’’
