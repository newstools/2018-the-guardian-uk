Gloucester have pledged to give Danny Cipriani their “full support” after he pleaded guilty to common assault and resisting arrest following an incident at a nightclub in Jersey. Cipriani was fined £2,000 and ordered to pay £250 in compensation to a police officer after she was left with a bruised arm and marks on her chin and neck. Gloucester confirmed that the 30-year-old fly-half, who has recently joined the West Country club after making his first England start in 10 years over the summer, is set to face a “robust but balanced” internal disciplinary action. The club stated also said that Cipriani is “very remorseful and “fully accepts the outcome and his punishment” following a 13-minute hearing at Jersey magistrates court on Thursday morning. The incident took place at around 2am on Wednesday during a night out as part of Gloucester’s pre-season tour. The club are due to travel to Belfast on Thursday evening to prepare for a pre-season fixture against Ulster. It is understood Cipriani’s involvement on that trip is likely to depend on the outcome of the club’s disciplinary process. The Gloucester chief executive, Stephen Vaughan, said: “We are very proud of the culture we have within the group and the stated values which we strive to deliver against. Incidents of this nature are very disappointing to be associated with, and we will deal with it in a robust but balanced way but based purely on the facts. “As a high-profile sportsperson there is often a large degree of public and media scrutiny involved, which Danny is well aware of. The incident in question was over in a matter of seconds and was a reaction to the conduct of other parties involved. “He knows his responsibilities and is aware of the impact of this type of incident on the club. However, Danny is a Gloucester Rugby player and will receive our full support as we focus on the exciting season ahead.”
