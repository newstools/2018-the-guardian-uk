Chop 20g of dill and 15g of parsley. Fold together 150ml of soured cream, the chopped herbs and a generous seasoning of salt and black pepper. Break 375g of hot smoked salmon into large, generous flakes. Add them to the soured cream and fold them in very gently, then refrigerate. Put a deep, medium-sized pan of water on to boil. Thinly slice 40g of sugar snap peas into long matchsticks. Trim 60g of green beans, removing the stalks and pointy tail ends as you wish. Lower the beans into the boiling water and leave for 3 or 4 minutes until they are vivid green and almost tender. Remove with a draining spoon or tongs and drain. Add the sugar snaps to the water, leave for 2 minutes then remove. Gently fold the salmon, drained peas and beans through the soured cream and herbs. Finely chop a couple of spring onions, add them to the salad and serve. Enough for 2 as a light main course. Some gentle handling is needed here. The dish will lose its point if over-mixed. The fish and its dressing needs nothing more than a light folding together, keeping the pieces of salmon in juicy chunks. The recipe works beautifully with smoked mackerel or trout. Instead of sugar snaps and green beans use batons of cucumber, seeded and lightly peeled, and breakfast radishes, sliced lengthways. If a soured cream dressing doesn’t work for you, try a mixture of mayonnaise and crème fraîche. Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@NigelSlater
