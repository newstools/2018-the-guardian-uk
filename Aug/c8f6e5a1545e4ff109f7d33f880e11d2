Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is to lend his support to a hard-Brexit campaign group, he has said. Farage accused MPs and the Lords of refusing to enact the result of the 2016 EU referendum and said he would join forces with the property tycoon Richard Tice to argue against Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal. Farage has backed the Leave Means Leave campaign Tice runs with John Longworth, the former head of the British Chambers of Commerce. “I have spent some time in the last week with Messrs Tice and Longworth. They have told me they intend to hold a series of public events throughout Britain to promote their message and help represent the views of Brexiteers,” Farage wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. James McGrory, of the pro-remain People’s Vote campaign group, said: “Nigel Farage has had more comebacks than Frank Sinatra, just without the success. “If he was serious about making a return to frontline politics, he would stand to be an MP. “I can only hope that Nigel Farage sticks to the promise he made live on TV to have a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.” Tice and Longworth have identified disillusioned Tory voters as their most likely supporters. “A number are so angry about what is going on that they have told us they will stop donating to the Conservative party unless there is a major change in approach,” they wrote in an article published on the Telegraph website on Thursday. Farage claimed that, since electors were asked to vote in the EU referendum 2016, “there has been virtually no input from the people at all apart from at the 2017 general election”. He accused Westminster of refusing to “acknowledge the wishes of the majority of those who took part in that historic plebiscite of 2016 by voting to leave the European Union”. The government triggered article 50, beginning the process of leaving the European Union, in March 2017, and parliament has passed legislation facilitating the move.
