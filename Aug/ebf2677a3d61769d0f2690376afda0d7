José Mourinho says he is happy with his relationship with the Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. United host Tottenham Hotspur on Monday in their first match since a dismal 3-2 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion last Sunday. The manner of the loss has caused further scrutiny of Mourinho and his team. The manager began the season unhappy at not acquiring a centre-back of choice, with Leicester City’s Harry Maguire among his targets. This occurred because of the stance of Woodward and his board that Maguire and others on Mourinho’s wanted list were no improvement on the centre-backs in his squad. Mourinho, asked whether his relationship with Woodward was fine, said: “Of course. No [problem].” After the defeat at Brighton, Paul Pogba admitted his attitude had been wrong. Mourinho would not be drawn on whether this was frustrating. “Paul said [this] – he has to answer for his words,” he said. “If you want any explanation about Paul’s words you must get him and ask him.”
