Wolves’ ambitious preparations for their Premier League return gathered pace on Wednesday as they signed Adama Traoré for a club-record £18m and prepared to bring in Anderlecht’s Leander Dendoncker and Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City. The Ukraine midfielder Zinchenko – who also featured for City at left-back last season – and Dendoncker, who played for Belgium against England in the World Cup finals in Russia, were pencilled in for medicals before their moves to Molineux. If both deals go through, it would take Wolves’ summer spending to around £84m with Zinchenko costing the club £16m and Dendoncker around £12m. The double deal would follow the signings of Traoré, Rui Patrício, Jonny Castro Otto, João Moutinho and Raúl Jiménez, who has joined on loan. Diogo Jota, Willy Boly, Léo Bonatini and Rúben Vinagre have also secured permanent deals after impressing on loan last season. Earlier, Wolves completed a club-record move for Traoré after meeting the Middlesbrough player’s release clause. The Spanish winger, who has signed a five-year contract at Molineux, told Wolves TV: “I’m so happy, it’s a great day for me and my family. I know the history of Wolves. It is a team with a big history.” “My mentality is to work every day and be prepared for whatever comes,” Traoré added. “Wolves are definitely ready for the Premier League. “My mentality is to fit in to the tactics but how Wolves play will definitely suit me . Before I make any decision I know how they play, how they move, how the wingers play.”
