To my surprise, about six weeks ago, I noticed on the Ikea website the kitchen hob I bought from them in 2016 was being recalled. Apparently, some are malfunctioning and emitting dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Ikea asked me to call the manufacturer. The manufacturer referred me back to Ikea. Multiple times it has refused to arrange a repair and promised callbacks that never happen. I tried to lodge a formal complaint in July but no response. DW, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire This is an unconscionable delay given the potential hazard of the hob. Ikea recalled the appliance back in April after discovering it could emit carbon monoxide above EU-imposed limits. It declines to comment on whether it attempted to contact customers directly, but apologises for not “living up to expectations” in your case. A technician was conjured up when the Observer intervened and you’ve received a repair and £100 goodwill. Ikea says that yours is an “isolated incident”.
