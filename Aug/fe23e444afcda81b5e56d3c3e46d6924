An Italian coastguard ship with 177 people on board has docked in the Sicilian seaport of Catania, but Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini has not given authorisation for the refugees and migrants to disembark. The passengers, who have been stuck on the coastguard boat Ubaldo Diciotti for five days will not be allowed on land until “Europe steps in to help’’, Salvini said. The Diciotti picked up 190 refugees and migrants last Wednesday from an overcrowded boat about 17 sea miles from the island of Lampedusa. Thirteen of them were evacuated for emergency medical treatment. Since then, Rome has insisted that Malta should take the group because their boat first passed through its search-and-rescue area. But Malta has refused, claiming that the migrants wanted to reach Italy. Questioned by the Italian authorities, the 13 evacuated migrants claimed that the Maltese had escorted them outside its search-and-rescue zone. On Monday afternoon, after three days of negotiations, Italy’s transport minister Danilo Toninelli announced finally on Twitter that “The Diciotti ship will dock in Catania.” But shortly afterwards, sources close to Salvini said he had not given the authorisation to disembark, suggesting the boat was granted permission to dock but the migrants will have to remain on board. Salvini said on Italian TV: “The ship may land in Italy, as long as the 177 migrants are distributed, in a spirit of solidarity by the EU.” The Diciotti finally docked in Catania on Monday at 11.53pm but the passengers were forced to remain inside the vessel. Most of the people on board are from Eritrea or Somalia. “They need assistance as soon a possible,” Giovanna Di Benedetto, a spokeswoman for Save The Children, told the Guardian. “Some of them have suffered several months, if not over a one year, of imprisonment in Libya's detention camps.” Brussels said it was in talks with EU states but did not specify which capitals were involved.
