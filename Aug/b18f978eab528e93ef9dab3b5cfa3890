A snake has been seen eating a pigeon on a busy street in east London. Photographs and video posted on social media showed the snake coiled around the bird on the pavement outside a shop on Leytonstone High Road on Saturday morning. The Evening Standard reported that onlookers had fed the already dead pigeon to the snake. A spokeswoman for the animal charity RSPCA, which was called to the incident, said it did not believe the snake hunted down and killed the bird.
