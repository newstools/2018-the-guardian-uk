Arsenal face a potential selection dilemma over the Armenia international Henrikh Mkhitaryan after the Europa League draw pitched the club against the Azerbaijani side Qarabag. The longstanding conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh means the two countries do not recognise each other diplomatically. When Borussia Dortmund travelled to Azerbaijan in 2015, Mkhitaryan was absent on security grounds but it is understood the midfielder would be able to get a visa to enter Azerbaijan should he and the club wish him to travel. Arsenal’s manager, Unai Emery, reacted positively to a draw that will see the squad travel around 10,000 miles to play their Group E fixtures but against opposition unlikely to pose too much trouble. Sporting Lisbon, currently experiencing a player revolt, and the Ukrainian side Vorskla Poltava complete the section. “We want to go far in this competition,” Emery said. The final takes place in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku. Chelsea face some long trips on their return to Europe’s second-tier competition for the first time since they lifted the trophy in 2013. Maurizio Sarri’s team have been drawn with Greek side Paok, the Belarusian champions, Bate Borisov, and the Hungarian title winners, Vidi, in Group L.
