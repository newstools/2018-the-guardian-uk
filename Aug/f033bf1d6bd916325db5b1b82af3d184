A leaked photo of the White House summer 2018 interns has again placed Donald Trump’s administration under scrutiny over its commitment to diversity, or lack thereof. A third of Americans in their 20s belong to a minority group, yet the unreleased press photo shows this season’s class struggling to represent anything like that – not unlike the makeup of the president’s cabinet. The minority members of Trump’s cabinet are few and far between, while 64% of Barack Obama’s first cabinet and cabinet-level officials were women or non-white men, according to a New York Times analysis. Compare and contrast the most recent intern class with a group from the fall 2016 program under the Obama administration.
