Egan Bernal has sustained serious facial trauma after a crash during the closing stages of the Clasica San Sebastian. The Team Sky cyclist, who has been tipped as a future Tour de France winner after his impressive debut in this year’s race, was carried away on a stretcher from the scene of a multi-rider crash in Donostia. Scans revealed he had sustained a nasal fracture and maxillary injury but it was reported he was awake and talking to doctors. He will spend the night in hospital for observation. Bernal had been prominent in the peloton before the final climb of the 228.7km race but crashed heavily in a crowd of other riders. Movistar’s Mikel Landa was also involved and both riders were placed into neck braces on the road – though Landa said to medics at the scene: “Quiet, I’m fine.” He also went to hospital, with a back injury. The race was won by the Quick-Step Floors cyclist Julian Alaphilippe in a sprint finish.
