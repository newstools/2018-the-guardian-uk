The Michigan attorney general’s office is defending the conduct of Larry Nassar’s sentencing judge and asking that she deny a defense request to disqualify herself from the former Michigan State University sports doctor’s appeal. The Detroit News reports that the attorney general’s office says in court documents filed Tuesday that judge Rosemarie Aquilina’s role was different than a trial judge when she sentenced Nassar after he pleaded guilty to molesting women and girls under the guise of medical treatment. Aquilina described Nassar as a “monster” and said she was signing his “death warrant” when ordered him to serve a 40- to 175-year sentence. Nassar’s attorneys say Aquilina was biased. The attorney general’s office says “a sentencing judge is permitted to use strong language.” Aquilina will hear arguments on Friday. The motion adds: “As the voice of the community, sentencing judge is permitted to use strong language to redress the victims and express the grievance of society.” Nassar’s attorneys say they believe Aquilina decided to impose the maximum allowed before the sentencing hearing even began, citing a series of statements including that she might let people do to Nassar what he did to the girls if the Constitution didn’t prohibit cruel and unusual punishment. Judge Aquilina told Nassar near the conclusion of the January hearing: “It is my honor to sentence you because, sir, you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again. Anywhere you walk, destruction would occur to those most vulnerable.” She added: “I just signed your death warrant.” Aquilina said the sentence reflected not only the seven counts to which Nassar pleaded guilty, but also the survivors who came forward during the sentencing hearing “because the depth of all of your crimes have cut into the core of this community”.
