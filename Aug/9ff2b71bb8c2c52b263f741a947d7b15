Joe Root has secured the Twenty20 experience he has long been craving. He and Jos Buttler are to play for Sydney Thunder in Australia’s Big Bash League in between England’s winter tours to Sri Lanka and the Caribbean. Root was dropped from England’s Twenty20 side for the series decider with India in July and has expressed fears of being “left behind” in the format because of the packed international schedule and his all-encompassing role as Test captain. A key member of the England side who reached the World Twenty20 final in 2016, the 27-year-old has since played only a dozen T20s games for his country and Yorkshire. In January he was unsold in the Indian Premier League auction. Now, though, the six-week gap between England’s third Test in Sri Lanka on 27 November and the tour to the Caribbean that begins in early January has allowed Root and Buttler to play seven matches during the first half of the BBL. Root built up a strong rapport with the Sydney Thunder coach, Shane Bond, while the former New Zealand fast bowler was working as a consultant during the first two Tests of the Ashes tour last November. For Buttler it is a case of rejoining his team from last season, having made two half-centuries and 202 runs in six appearances. While the pair have been cleared to play by England, despite some concerns behind the scenes over their workloads, it remains to be seen whether Ben Stokes will be join them in Australia amid cooling interest from the Sydney Sixers. The franchise is waiting for the outcome of the Cricket Discipline Commission’s investigation into after the street fight in Bristol last September that resulted in the all-rounder being cleared of affray but still facing possible sporting sanctions for bring the game into disrepute.
