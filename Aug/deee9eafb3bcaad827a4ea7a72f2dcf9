Barcelona have completed the signing of Arturo Vidal from Bayern Munich after agreeing personal terms with the Chile midfielder over a £27m transfer. The 31-year-old, who moved to Germany in 2015 from Juventus for £32m, met Barça officials last week and passed his medical after being granted permission to leave by the new Bayern manager, Niko Kovac. Barcelona have already spent more than £100m this summer on deals for the French defender Clément Lenglet and the Brazilian pair Arthur and Malcom and had been in negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain over a move for Adrien Rabiot. But the French champions’ unwillingness to allow the 23-year-old to leave Parc des Princes led to them turning their attention to Vidal. Internazionale had been seen as the frontrunners for his signature but have now made an ambitious approach to sign Luka Modric from Real Madrid. Barça are also close to completing a move for the Senegal defender Moussa Wagué, who became the youngest African to score in the World Cup finals in June. The 19-year-old is initially expected to join Barcelona’s B side from the Belgian club Eupen. Milan confirmed the signing of Gonzalo Higuaín and Mattia Caldara from Juventus after the pair had their medicals with Milan on Thursday. Higuaín joins on a season-long loan, with Milan having the option to make the deal permanent next summer. Caldara arrives as part of a swap deal for Leonardo Bonucci, who has rejoined the Turin club as part of the deal.
