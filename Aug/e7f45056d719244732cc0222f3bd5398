Drug overdoses killed more than 72,000 people in the United States last year – a new record driven by the deadly opioid epidemic, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC estimates that 72,287 people died from overdoses in 2017, an increase of about 10% from the year before. A majority of the deaths – nearly 49,000 – was caused by opioids, according to the new data. And the biggest driver was the dangerous synthetic opioid fentanyl, which killed more than 29,000 people, followed by heroin and other drugs. The rising overdose numbers make the drug epidemic more deadly than gun violence, car crashes, or Aids, which have never killed as many people in a single year. It represents nearly 200 people dying from overdoses every day in 2017. The highest death rates came in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Some states – Massachusetts, Vermont, Wyoming and Montana – have begun to reduce their number of deaths. But across the country deaths have continued to rise, despite efforts to tackle the spread of opioid addiction through education, treatment, and law enforcement measures. The CDC’s statistics are preliminary because some deaths are still under investigation. Last year, the Trump administration declared a “public health emergency,” calling the epidemic “worst drug crisis in American history.” But the declaration did not come with additional funding to treat or prevent drug addiction. The surge in fentanyl, which is synthetically produced and can be 50 times stronger than heroin, has led to a sharp spike in deaths even as use of opioids overall has been rising for years. The drug is mostly brought into the country from overseas, especially China, and sometimes mixed in with heroin without users knowing it.
