Lewis Hamilton claimed pole for the Belgian Grand Prix, once again mastering wet conditions to find the absolute best from his Mercedes when it mattered on his final lap, beating Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel in to second. The renamed Racing Point Force India enjoyed a huge success in their first outing after being bought out of administration, with Esteban Ocon in third and Sergio Pérez in fourth. Ferrari had looked to have the quicker car over the weekend in dry conditions but late rain during qualifying once again gave Mercedes the advantage. Their car is stronger in the wet and Hamilton is able to exploit it to maximum effect. He won in Germany in heavy rain and did superbly to put his car in pole in the wet at the last round in Hungary. Once again his feel on a greasy track made a crucial difference. Rain had begun falling at the start of Q3 and became progressively heavier, initial runs on slicks proved impossible and the teams promptly pitted without setting a time to take intermediate tyres. With five minutes remaining the first times were set and the drivers stayed out looking for grip as the rain began to ease. Raikkonen held provisional pole, but Vettel went quicker, while Hamilton struggled, going off on his penultimate quick run. He had saved the best for last however, his final run a majestic display of finding grip when it mattered in mixed conditions as the track dried around him. His second and final sectors were unmatched and he finished seven-tenths clear of Vettel and a full three seconds up on Ocon, with a time of 1min 58.179sec. Hamilton’s sixth pole of the season is the first time he has scored two in a row in 2018. His fifth pole in Belgium surpasses the record previously shared by Juan Manuel Fangio, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. He converted the top spots he secured in 2015 and 2017 to wins, of which he has three here including one for McLaren in 2010. It is his 78th career pole and Hamilton won here last season from the front, with track position proving crucial. Given that the Mercedes and Ferrari are so closely matched in pace it is an advantage the British driver will look to exploit again. He leads Vettel by 24 points in the world championship and while the largely power-dependent circuit here has played to Mercedes’ strengths in recent years Ferrari have been far more competitive and denying them pole with what had previously been a straightline speed advantage is a result Mercedes will celebrate. They had not found their optimum set up in the first two practice sessions with Hamilton third and second on the Friday and third on Saturday morning behind the Ferraris. When it counted however he managed to find exactly what was required. Spa presents good prospects for overtaking but whether Vettel will be able to enjoy enough of a pace advantage even with DRS is the key question and it seems unlikely. If Hamilton can keep his nose clean through La Source and hold off the charge from Vettel by Les Combes he will hold the whip hand for the race. Valtteri Bottas finished in 10th place but will start from 19th having taken new power unit components. Kimi Raikkonen was in sixth. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was in seventh in front of his teammate Daniel Ricciardo. The Haas cars of Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen were in fifth and ninth. 1 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes GP 1min 58.179sec, 2 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:58.905, 3 Esteban Ocon (Fr) Force India 2:01.851, 4 Sergio Pérez (Mex) Force India 2:01.894, 5 Romain Grosjean (Fr) Haas F1 2:02.122, 6 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 2:02.671, 7 Max Verstappen (Neth) Red Bull 2:02.769, 8 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Red Bull 2:02.939, 9 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 2:04.933, 10 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes GP No Time, 11 Pierre Gasly (Fr) Toro Rosso 1:43.844, 12 Brendon Hartley (NZ) Toro Rosso 1:43.865, 13 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Sauber 1:44.062, 14 Marcus Ericsson (Swe) Sauber 1:44.301, 15 Nico Hülkenberg (Ger) Renault No Time, 16 Carlos Sainz Jr (Sp) Renault 1:44.489, 17 Fernando Alonso (Sp) McLaren 1:44.917, 18 Sergey Sirotkin (Rus) Williams 1:44.998, 19 Lance Stroll (Can) Williams 1:45.134, 20 Stoffel Vandoorne (Bel) McLaren 1:45.307 Nico Hülkenberg, was in 15th place, with Renault opting not to set a time in Q2 since he will start from the back of the grid owing to penalties imposed for fitting new power unit components.
