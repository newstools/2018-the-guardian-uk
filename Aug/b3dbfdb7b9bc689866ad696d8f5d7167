A 6.9 magnitude earthquake in Lombok which struck on Sunday has killed at least 98 people and severely injured more than 200. Lombok was hit by another quake last week, with more than 100 aftershocks hit the area since Sunday. The island, which is popular with tourists, has experienced “massive” damage in the north according to a spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said. Rescue efforts were hampered overnight by power outages, broken bridges and a lack of phone reception in some areas, making it difficult to immediately assess the full extent of the damage.
