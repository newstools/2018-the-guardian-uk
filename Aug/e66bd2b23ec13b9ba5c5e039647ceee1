England have called up Surrey’s Ollie Pope for Thursday’s second Test against India at Lord’s. The 20-year-old, who has scored 684 runs in the County Championship at an average of 85.50 this season, comes into the squad as Dawid Malan is dropped. The right-handed batsman has already hit three centuries this season as Malan has struggled at the crease while also dropping three catches in the 31-run victory over India at Edgbaston. The Warwickshire all-rounder Chris Woakes returns to the squad in place of Durham’s Ben Stokes, who faces a court hearing this coming week in Bristol. However, much of the focus will be on Pope who has been talked up as an England prospect after coming through the Lions setup. He was a regular in the Young Lions squads during 2016-17 and played for the Lions in their first-class fixture against India A last month where he scored an unbeaten 50 in a 253-run victory at New Road. The national selector Ed Smith said: “Ollie Pope has made an exceptional start to his first class career. He has reached a 1,000 first class runs in just 15 matches and is the first division’s stand-out batsman this season with 684 runs at 85. The selection panel believe that Ollie’s performances and character suggest he is well suited to international cricket. “Dawid Malan drops out of the squad for Lord’s. Dawid has not found his best rhythm this season, and it may be that his game is better suited to overseas conditions. “Ben Stokes is unavailable, but Chris Woakes, with some extra matches and practices under his belt, can now return to the England squad after injury.” Joe Root (Yorkshire), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Jimmy Anderson (Lancashire), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Alastair Cook (Essex), Sam Curran (Surrey), Keaton Jennings (Lancashire), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Jamie Porter (Essex), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire)
