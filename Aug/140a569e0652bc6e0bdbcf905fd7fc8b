Jürgen Klopp has said any player unhappy at being overlooked at Liverpool has a responsibility to force his way back into the manager’s plans on the training ground. Klopp admitted last week he had “no explanation” for why Alberto Moreno and others did not make the squad for the Premier League opener against West Ham. Dominic Solanke, Curtis Jones and Ragnar Klavan, who joined Cagliari for £2m on Friday, also missed out and the competition for places will intensify when Dejan Lovren and Joël Matip regain fitness. “I cannot make people happy, I never could,” said Klopp, whose team visit Crystal Palace on Monday. “Whatever happens on 31 August there will be a specific point where it is clear that is the squad for the next four months until January. Who cannot be happy in these four months being part of the squad at Liverpool I cannot help. “Everyone who trains on his highest level – because the decision has already been made that they are good enough to play for Liverpool – has a big chance to be an important part of the team, to stay in the team and all these things. “There are more difficult things in life than not being in a match-day squad. I see it like that and you always have a chance to change the situation when you are part of the squad. It is not about my decision. I made the last decision but before that there are plenty of things the players are responsible for.”
