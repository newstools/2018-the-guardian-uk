If you find keeping up with the Kardashians painful, prepare yourself for news that might make your skin crawl. Over the last couple of days, Kim Kardashian West and a slew of other celebrities have been showing off “body modifications” that look like abnormal growths. Rest assured, however, they are not abnormal growths – they are “art”. On Monday, Kardashian West posted an Instagram story of what appears to be a choker implanted into her neck. Chrissy Teigen also posted a photo of herself on social media wearing what looks like angel wings sprouting from her chest, while Queer Eye’s Tan France shared a selfie in which he appears to be wearing a ruffled collar made of human skin around his neck. #ahuman @ahuman pic.twitter.com/8pbdQi78kP You guys!!!

Human (@ahuman) on Aug 28, 2018 at 6:16am PDT Despite their appearance these slightly terrifying accessories are not actually implanted into the skin. They are part of an upcoming exhibition on body modification run by A Human, which describes itself as “a fashion brand from the future where self-expression isn’t defined by what you put on your body, but how you change your body”. The human behind A Human is Simon Huck. While Huck is best known for being a friend of the Kardashian family, he also works in PR and appeared, alongside his business partner Jonathan Cheban, on a 2010 reality show about celebrity PR called The Spin Crowd. The show caused some controversy when Cheban was seen convincing a young employee to get lip injections, even though she didn’t want them. A Human will exhibit a debut collection at its flagship store in New York during New York fashion week in September. It costs $40 to visit the store. In exchange, you get the opportunity to shop “everything from bespoke hearts for you and your lover to biological heels that stem from your legs”.
