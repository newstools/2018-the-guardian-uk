Odell Beckham Jr has agreed to a five-year extension with the New York Giants, ESPN reported on Monday. The three-time Pro Bowl wide receiver will earn a guaranteed $65m over the course of the deal and could receive up to $95m depending on production, making him the highest-paid player at his position, the network reported. Beckham, who had been slated to make $8.4m this season on the fifth-year option of his rookie contract, is now under contract through the 2023 season. The 25-year-old from Louisiana recorded at least 90 receptions, 1,300 yards and 10 touchdowns in each of his first three NFL seasons before missing 12 games with a broken left ankle in last year’s fourth campaign as the Giants slumped to the NFC’s worst record. Beckham’s deal would appear to have surpassed the previous benchmarks for wideout contracts in the NFL held by the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Antonio Brown, who is earning $17m per season under his current deal, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Mike Evans, whose contract includes $55m in total guaranteed money.
