Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Place 400g of small peppers, 250g of cherry tomatoes and 400g of small aubergines in a roasting tin. Tuck 6 fat garlic cloves, still in their skins, and 3 large sprigs of rosemary among the vegetables, then spoon over 5 tbsp of olive oil. Let the vegetables roast in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until they are approaching softness, then push them to one side of the tin and tip a 650g jar (or 2 x 400g cans) of butter beans into the tin. Stir the beans to coat them in oil and roasting juices, then return to the oven and cook for a further 20 minutes until all is soft and golden. Tip in the warm beans and process to a thick, fluffy purée Remove the garlic from the roasting tin and squeeze each clove from its skin into the bowl of a food processor. Tip in the warm beans and process to a thick, fluffy purée. Check the seasoning then pile the purée on to a serving plate and place the vegetables on top. Spoon over any juices. If you can track down the large, flat Judion beans in jars then I recommend them for this. They are particularly soft and buttery, and produce a cloud-like mash. Canned butter beans work well enough, are cheap as chips and easier to locate. You may like to add a thick slice of butter as you mash them. The vegetables can be roasted ahead of time and served warm or even cold, but the beans must be mashed while they are still warm, if you are to achieve a smooth finish. Once the weather cools and summer slides towards autumn, you could roast slices of orange-fleshed squash instead of the aubergines, or use parsnips in place of the butter beans. The real point of the dish is the sweet, herb-infused roasting juices trickling into the cloud of mash. Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@NigelSlater
