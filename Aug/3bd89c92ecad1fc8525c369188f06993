I’m counting down the days until I go on my annual trip back to Algeria, or “bled” as we call it, the motherland. Tickets cost a stupid amount, because the big Eid falls in August this year. But it will be worth it when I get out of the hammam on the first day. When I was little, we went to the public baths because there was no running water in the flats where my family lived – in Oran, Algeria’s second city. Now it’s a choice. Tata Houeria, my favourite uncle’s wife, jumps at any excuse to go to the hammam, especially when I’m visiting and she can get her hands on me. She has taught me the power of communal bathing. The hammam is not just about washing; it’s a social activity that brings the women of the family together. It’s also about ritual; Houeria takes pleasure in carefully packing the soap, loofahs and stools into a special bag. Once inside, women exchange their black abayas for white towels before stepping into the hot, steamy room. Toddlers and the elderly are bathed by family members while they gossip with friends. As soon as I feel the steam, I’m transported back to being very small and stroking my aunt’s buttery-soft skin. She always finds the strongest masseuse, often the one with a cigarette dangling from her lips, to give me a proper scrub down on a marble slab. As they scrape the pollution off my skin, I am scolded for not going to the hammam in London. My feeble attempts to exfoliate can’t compare with what these women do. My cousins and I now extend the ritual with a trip to the salon to get our hair done. I come out feeling fresh, content and cared for, which is pretty much how I feel after going back to bled. You can’t put a price on that. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.
