Nabil Fekir has reignited speculation over his future by suggesting he could still move away from Lyon in this transfer window. Fekir was on the verge of a £53m transfer to Liverpool in June only to see his switch to Anfield placed on hold because of concerns over the France international’s fitness. Liverpool had hoped to announce the 25-year-old before the World Cup began and the deal was so advanced he had agreed personal terms on a five-year contract and also conducted an introductory interview with LFCTV, the club’s in-house television channel. The attacking midfielder, who was a key transfer target for Jürgen Klopp this summer, ruptured a cruciate ligament in September 2015 that caused him to miss the majority of the 2015-16 campaign. He also missed several weeks of last season with a knee problem. Fekir, who has also now been linked with Chelsea, returned to training with Lyon on Monday after helping his country win the World Cup and, despite being happy at the Ligue 1 club, admitted he was unsure about his future. “As you can see, I am in Lyon. I am very good here,” he told the Lyon club website. “But the transfer window is still long and everything goes very fast in football. We do not know what will happen in the future but I am very good at OL. I feel great in the group. We have very good players, there is a good atmosphere. We live well and I hope that OL will have a great season.” The Lyon captain scored 18 times in Ligue 1 last season, as well as providing eight assists, to help his side finish third and secure Champions League qualification. The 25-year-old then made six substitute appearances at the World Cup finals in Russia as France lifted the trophy for the second time.
