Six teenagers are to appear in court in connection with the death of an Egyptian engineering student. Mariam Moustafa, was left in a coma after she was attacked by a group of girls outside a shopping centre in Nottingham earlier this year. Nottinghamshire police said six female teenagers – including three 17-year-olds, two 15-year-olds and a 19-year-old – have been summoned to appear at Nottingham magistrates court on 27 September to answer charges of affray. Moustafa was taken to the city’s Queen’s Medical Centre for treatment after she was beaten outside the Intu Victoria shopping centre on 20 February. The 18-year-old, who had just been offered a place at university in London, had originally been discharged, but her condition deteriorated at home and she was rushed back to hospital. She had a stroke and died in hospital on 14 March. Ch Supt Rob Griffin previously said the force remained committed to seeing “that justice is done”. He said: “Nottinghamshire police, working closely with colleagues from the east midlands major crime unit, have carried out a thorough and professional investigation into this case. “During the investigation we have meticulously gathered all of the available evidence. We have now provided the CPS with all of that evidence, so that they can now consider it and reach a decision over the next steps in the case. “I have been in regular contact with Mariam’s family and their legal representative and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been in close touch with Egyptian authorities over the course of the last five months to keep them fully informed of the progress of the investigation.” Moustafa, who had been offered a place at university in London, was born in Rome, where her family had moved from Egypt in 1991. Italian prosecutors also opened an investigation into her death.
