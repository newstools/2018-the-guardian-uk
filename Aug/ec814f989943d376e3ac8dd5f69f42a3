The MotoGP race director Mike Webb blamed the newly laid surface at Silverstone after the British Grand Prix was cancelled following repeated delays on Sunday after rain made conditions too dangerous for riders. Having initially attempted to bring the start time forward in anticipation of bad weather only to be frustrated by persistent rain, organisers conducted a track inspection at 3pm and were hopeful that the race could start even as late as 5pm. However, pools of standing water on the track, which was relaid in February, meant the race was called off, with no option of holding the race on Monday. Webb said: “We’ve had a number of years’ experience here in very wet conditions recently with the old surface and have been able to run races. This year, with the new surface, is the first time we’ve encountered quite so much standing water in critical places on the track. So, yes, it’s a direct result of the track surface. “The staff have done an unbelievable effort over the whole weekend to try and make the track safe and until the last minute they were still working, but unfortunately we couldn’t battle nature.” The Pramac Ducati rider Jack Miller and Johann Zarco of Tech3 were in favour of the race going ahead but were overruled by the overwhelming majority of riders present in a safety commission meeting. Miller said Tito Rabat’s crash in practice, in which he suffered a broken leg, had been a factor. “It’s a case of the guys don’t want to ride,” Miller told BT Sport. “They are not happy with how the asphalt was working in terms of the drainage and because of the accident yesterday involving Tito. “It’s a shame for me, cancelling it already. We were talking about waiting for the weather to clear up a little bit and stuff like that.” Alberto Puig, the Repsol Honda team manager, said: “It’s not an easy day for anyone, this is clear. Not a good day for the fans, the organisers, the teams, the riders. But you cannot go against nature, and this is the story.”
