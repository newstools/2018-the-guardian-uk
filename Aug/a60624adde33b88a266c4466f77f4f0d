A teenager suffered serious leg injuries and another person escaped after a police car crashed into their moped and flipped during a high-speed chase on roads near Buckingham Palace. Police began tailing the moped, its rider and pillion passenger at Hyde Park Corner at about 4.30am, after it matched the description of a vehicle believed to have been involved in a series of crimes. Seconds later, in Grosvenor Place at the junction with Chapel Street, adjacent to the walls surrounding the grounds of Buckingham Palace, the moped collided with a second marked police car travelling in the opposite direction. A boy aged 17 was injured in the collision and was taken to hospital. He has since been arrested on suspicion of a number of motoring offences. Police are trying to trace the second rider, who fled the scene. No officers were seriously injured or required medical treatment. The Metâ€™s directorate of professional standards has been informed and a referral has been made to the Independent Office of Police Conduct.
