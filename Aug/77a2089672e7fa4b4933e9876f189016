Anthony Martial is set to return to training with Manchester United on Thursday after tweeting he will be back in the city following the birth of his child, which the forward says was difficult for his partner. Martial left United’s tour of the US before the game against Milan last Wednesday in Los Angeles to attend the birth in Paris. After United’s final tour match, Wednesday’s 2-1 win over Real Madrid in Miami, José Mourinho stated he did not know when the Frenchman would be back with the squad. Yet later the same day Martial tweeted: “Thank you all for your posts. My little Swan is fine, for the mum it was harder but thanks to God she’s better now. Sorry but my family will always come first … Back tomorrow in Manchester.” Martial wants to leave United due to a lack of game-time, with the manager reluctantly minded to allow him to, though only if the club’s valuation of the 22-year-old is met. Relations between the player and the manager have become strained with Mourinho questioning his attitude.
