A French woman has been praised for her courage in standing up to a street harasser in Paris. Marie Laguerre, 22, was punched by a man she had told to shut up after he catcalled her on the street. This extreme incident has sparked a discussion on social media about how common it is for women to be harassed on France’s streets, an issue felt across the world. Gender-based street harassment – from catcalls, sexually explicit comments to leering and assault – is far too prevalent. Many people ignore it, think catcalling is “banter” or part of “lad culture”, or just tolerate it as part of some people’s daily experience.
