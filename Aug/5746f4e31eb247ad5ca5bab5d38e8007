A knife attacker killed his mother and sister on a street in the Paris suburb of Trappes, and seriously injured one other person, police have confirmed. The man stabbed the women at about 10am on Thursday. He then hid inside a house on a quiet street. He was shot by police and killed, a police source confirmed. The French state prosecutor and police have not indicated what they believe was the motive. Local police are leading the investigation, rather than counter-terrorism officers. The French interior minister, Gérard Collomb, said the attacker had psychiatric issues. The attacker, a man in his 30s from Trappes, had been stopped by police in 2016 for publicly making comments in support of terrorism, but at the time he had been known for psychiatric problems. The minister said he wasn’t considered to be someone engaged in terrorism. Trappes is a town of about 30,000 people west of Paris.
