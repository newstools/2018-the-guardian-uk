I have an extremely large penis. According to an online size chart, I’m in the top 1% in the world. It’s not something that you can really brag about or bring up at dinner parties, but it does have an interesting impact on your sex life. For many men, the idea of an enormous penis may seem like a golden ticket, but it isn’t without complications. When my wife first saw me naked she was rather intimidated by the idea of penetrative sex, and it took us several months of practice before we were even partially successful. We’ve been together almost five years and I could count on one hand the number of times we’ve managed to achieve full penetration. We persist because we feel it’s an important way to feel close to each other, but it requires patience and effort. My wife needs to have an orgasm and uses two vibrators of differing sizes, before she is mentally and physically relaxed enough to take me. Fortunately, we still have a really active love life, and I really enjoy our time together in the bedroom. There’s plenty of kissing, cuddles and mutual masturbation. I have to be careful receiving oral sex, so my wife taps me on the leg if it’s getting too much. Ironically, having a porn-sized penis teaches you that penetrative intercourse – the fixation of pornography – is far from the most important thing when it comes to having an enjoyable sex life with a loving partner. Despite everything, my wife says she loves me just the way I am. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.
