Team racing is seemingly on its way to becoming a thing in this country, judging by a press release this morning from Championship Horse Racing which tells me eight racecourses in Britain and Ireland have signed up to be part of “The Series” next summer. This is a proposed run of Thursday night fixtures to take place from late July to early September in which teams of racehorses accumulate points by finishing position. The idea is by no means past the post yet, because these fixtures have not yet been approved by the British Horseracing Authority. “We are in dialogue with the organisers,” a BHA spokesman tells me. “We will consider any application for extra fixtures on their merits, once received.” However, CHR (that’s Championship Horse Racing to you) must be odds-on to get approval if they can actually deliver on their promises because they are seeking to stage 48 races, all of which will offer more than £100,000 in prize money. No details are offered yet as to which trainers or owners will supply the horses to run in this series, or where the money will come from. You may recall that one of the organisers predicted in February that the scheme could become “a brand playground”, a concept to set your teeth on edge if ever there was one. If a brand has signed up yet, we are not told. For now, we know the proposed venues: Ayr, Epsom, Goodwood, Haydock, Leopardstown, Newbury, Newmarket and Sandown. In common with the City Racing proposal that had a successful trial last week, Championship Horse Racing also has the backing of the Jockey Club and would also like to be known as racing’s answer to cricket’s Twenty20, a means of simplifying and popularising the sport. It’s nice to think that our great game will be so much more popular this time next year ... On Thursday at Wincanton, I’m interested in Reikers Island (1.30), a point to point winner who pleased with his attitude on his chasing debut at Exeter last month but rather overdid the early enthusiasm and got tired on his first run since April. With that run behind him and at this sharper track, I think he’ll last home rather more strongly and odds of 13-2 appeal. Seven-year-old maidens are generally to be avoided but Lizzie Langton (2.35) has a chance to get off the mark after a promising third at Lingfield on her reappearance, her first run since wind surgery. If the step up in trip is a help to her, she can get in the argument at 11-2. Over at Market Rasen, punters are going mad for a Dan Skelton recruit, Rocku, who was last seen getting stuffed at Sedgefield 600 days ago. As a result, we’re offered 3-1 about Point N Shoot (3.00), who was in the form of his life when last seen in the spring. If Rocku has not, in fact, been utterly transformed by Skelton, there’s hardly any depth to this race.
