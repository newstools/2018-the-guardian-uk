“Every morning I wake up around 8am for work and I go straight to the Rouje office. Even on the weekend I get up around 8.30 because I’m a morning person I love to have time in the morning for thinking.” “The first thing I do in the morning is feed my cat before she kills me.” “For breakfast I have bread and butter and coffee - very classic.” “I like not really thinking about it. My go-to is feminine dresses usually in a floral print and beautiful knitwear. I also wear a lot of tailoring and jeans, I love a 70s denim kick flare. Basically, anything which is easy and comfortable.” One million of you! Thanks for all the love and support 💐💘 A post shared by  Jeanne (@jeannedamas) on Nov 3, 2018 at 7:21am PDT “I do my makeup very quickly in five minutes: I moisturise with Elixir nutritif by Joëlle Ciocco, curl my lashes (I don’t use mascara), gel my eyebrows, and I add lipstick to my lips and cheeks.” “I usually do pilates and I run a couple of mornings a week.” “Generally I like Philou, Casimir or Le Champollion when it’s a work lunch and brunch at home with friends on the weekend.” “It’s all work, work, work midweek! I finish around 7pm so I start relaxing around 7.30pm. On a weekend I go twice to the cinema and I love meeting with friends for dinner, usually at Martin or Clown Bar.” “I like my evening routine to be very relaxed and quiet. I usually go to bed quite early like 11pm, I like to read in my bed or listen to a podcast like La Poudre from Lauren Bastide as I go to sleep.” Jeanne Damas is currently the face of Mango’s Journeys campaign
