Grace Millane’s father and uncle have visited the bushland area in New Zealand where the 22-year-old backpacker’s body was found. Millane disappeared from Auckland on 1 December and was found dead in the Waitakere Ranges area west of the city a week later. A 26-year-old man has been charged with her murder and is being held on remand, scheduled to appear in the high court in January. David Millane and his brother attended a private Māori blessing at the bushland site 20km from the city centre hotel where Millane was last seen alive. The traditional blessing was overseen by a kaumātua [Māori elder], and is part of the local grieving process to allow loved ones to begin making peace with Millane’s death. David Millane was photographed sharing a hongi [nose press] with a local uniformed police officer. A post-mortem examination has now been completed on Millane’s body, and she has been formally identified. “Work continues to piece together exactly what happened to Grace, as we build a timeline of the circumstances,” Detective Inspector Scott Beard said on Wednesday. Millane’s family are now organising for her body to be returned to the UK to allow a funeral to be held in her home town of Wickford, Essex. Candlelight vigils were planned for Millane in every New Zealand city on Wednesday, many organised by women’s refuges and anti-violence advocates. A vigil was held in Queenstown, in the South Island, on Tuesday night. About 100 locals gathered in the rain to light candles and sing songs. A family friend of Millane’s was visiting Queenstown, and lit candles on a pink birthday cake for her. Millane turned 22 the day after she went missing. “She was an amazing, lovely, innocent little girl,” said Josh Lewis, a Millane family friend from the UK. Millane’s murder has shaken New Zealanders, with grief experts saying many people are experiencing “vicarious trauma” about the murder in the usually safe country.
