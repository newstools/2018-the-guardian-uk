A Strictly Come Dancing star has spoken of how his brother saved his life – and risked his own dancing career – when the pair were attacked in a nightclub. AJ Pritchard, 24, a professional dancer, suffered bruising to his face, arms, legs and body in the incident, which took place during a night out with friends in Cheshire on 27 December. His brother, Curtis Pritchard, was left unconscious and requires surgery on his knee. He has been forced to pull out of the next series of Dancing With The Stars Ireland. AJ told the Sun: “Curtis risked his own dancing career to save mine as he threw himself in front of the attackers so they couldn’t get to me. He was thinking of both my dancing career with my legs and my TV career with my face. “He tried to protect me and in doing so saved my life and my legs from danger.” Cheshire police said a 20-year-old man had been arrested following the incident at the Nakatcha nightclub in Nantwich. He was later released under investigation. AJ, who finished fifth in this year’s Strictly series alongside celebrity partner Lauren Steadman, said the pair were attacked “out of the blue” by eight men on the dancefloor. Curtis, 22, was shoved to the side before the brothers were “punched and kicked from all angles”, the Strictly star told the paper. AJ said the attackers singled out his brother when Curtis tried to shield him from the blows. Curtis said he blacked out after taking at least three punches to the face before being stamped on while on the floor. Security staff closed the club following the melee as the brothers were taken to hospital. The brothers believe the assault was sparked by the attention AJ was receiving from female fans, according to the Sun. Curtis said the incident on the dancefloor could have ended his career. “I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t dance again,” he told the paper. “I just hope that the operation can save me. Something can go wrong on the operating table. There’s a chance my dancing career is over.”
