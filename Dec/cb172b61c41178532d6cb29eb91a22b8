Chelsea and the Metropolitan police have launched investigations after footage of a fan allegedly aiming racist abuse at Raheem Sterling was circulated online. The incident, which took place in the first half of Chelsea’s 2-0 Premier League win over Manchester City as Sterling went to pick up the ball in front of the Matthew Harding Stand, prompted Chelsea to issue a statement pledging to “investigate the matter and take the strongest possible action where necessary”. The Met said no arrests had been made, but added: “We are aware of a video circulating online in which it is claimed racial abuse was allegedly directed at a player … We will review the footage to determine whether any offences have been committed.” The incident prompted widespread condemnation online, with the former Crystal Palace and Arsenal striker Ian Wright tweeting: “The bad old days are back.”
