Ole Gunnar Solskjær has said he is focused on getting Manchester United’s players to “enjoy” their football again following the sacking of José Mourinho. The former United striker, who has been placed in charge at Old Trafford for the remainder of the season, told MUTV in his first interview: “It’s great. It feels like coming home, I have to say. It’s been a few whirlwind days, of course, it’s been very hectic, but it’s just great to see everyone again.” The Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has been identified as the preferred long-term replacement for Mourinho but Solskjær is keen to make an impact. “Well, it’s six months and I’m going to enjoy the ride,” he added. “It’s about just being myself. Manchester United is in my heart and it’s brilliant to be coming back in this role. I’m really looking forward to working with the very talented squad we have, the staff and everyone at the club. I know the club is now running a process to find the next manager, so I’m just going to be myself in the meantime with Mick [Phelan] and Kieran [McKenna] and Michael [Carrick] and the rest of the staff.” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: #MUFC caretaker manager 🔴Watch the rest of Ole's interview in our official app — download now for free: https://t.co/XN0xvwDZOO pic.twitter.com/egHH9dORpu Solskjær, who could be without Romelu Lukaku for his first two matches in charge after the striker was reportedly taking compassionate leave, was keen to underline the importance of uniting the club and restoring pride after a turbulent few months under Mourinho. “When I scored on my debut it was a brilliant feeling. You felt comfortable at Old Trafford and you want the players to feel at home there too. “It’s about the players being proud of their performance and the fans being proud of their team. We’ll just get the players enjoying football, and I’m looking forward to seeing the supporters again. “We want to see the players express themselves. I’m proud of my career as a player. I understand this club, I know the club. Being in the gaffer’s seat is very special.” The 45-year-old also offered up the suggestion that players such as Paul Pogba, who had fallen out of favour under Mourinho’s watch, would be given a chance to resume their United careers. “Everyone in the squad knows that ‘I’ve got a chance now’ because whatever has gone, whatever has happened has happened. Now it’s just about from here. “Everyone starts with a clean slate and we want players to perform, and we’ll give them the chance. We have got 23, 24 players, they’re all quality and they’ll all get a chance now. With the amount of games coming up, they have got a chance to show that they are Manchester United players.”
