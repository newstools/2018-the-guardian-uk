Jadon Sancho’s fine finish set Borussia Dortmund up for a home win over Mönchengladbach as the Bundesliga leaders bounced back from their first league loss to restore their nine-point cushion. The teenage England winger picked up a pass from substitute Mario Götze, dribbled away from his marker and scored from the tightest of angles just before half-time to the break the deadlock against second-placed Gladbach. Dortmund had began at a furious pace with Reus and Paco Alcácer posing a threat, but after the German saw an early shot blocked, Alcácer was forced off with a muscle injury with Götze replacing him. Having made their first-half dominance pay, Dortmund found themselves unexpectedly pegged back before half-time. Christoph Kramer rifled the ball home on his comeback from injury in stoppage time, although there was a suspicion of handball as he brought the ball down. Sancho played a part in Dortmund’s second goal, but it was their old guard who finished the move, Götze crossing low for Reus to prod the ball past Yann Sommer for his 11th goal of the season. WHAT. A. TALENT! Jadon Sancho teased the Monchengladbach defence just before firing Dortmund ahead at Westfalenstadion! 🖤 💛 pic.twitter.com/TojjHpfxKi “It was tough at the start, and for us it was important to be patient and keep the spaces tight,” Reus told reporters. “I am proud of the team because we gave it all we’ve got, every little bit, and we got the result we wanted.” Having suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Fortuna Düsseldorf in midweek, Dortmund are now on 42 points at the halfway stage. Gladbach are nine points behind, but could be overtaken by Bayern Munich, who visit Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Jonathan Calleri claimed the only goal as Alavés climbed to fifth place in La Liga – just one point behind Real Madrid – with a 1-0 win in a Basque derby at Real Sociedad. The former West Ham loanee headed home Borja Bastón’s 11th-minute cross to end his side’s run of four league games without victory and keep their unlikely push for European football on track. Sociedad dominated possession at Anoeta but were unable to find a leveller, Adnan Januzah and Mikel Oyarzabal going close as they slipped to a fourth successive league defeat. Getafe moved up to sixth place in the table but had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Girona, as Bernardo Espinosa’s header five minutes from time cancelled out Ángel’s volleyed opener on the hour mark.
