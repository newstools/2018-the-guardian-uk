Internazionale failed to get the win that would have seen them into the Champions League last 16, drawing 1-1 with PSV Eindhoven on a fraught night at the San Siro. The hosts fell behind early on, but Mauro Icardi’s equaliser after 73 minutes meant the Italians were going through with Tottenham 1-0 down at Barcelona. After news of Lucas Moura’s crucial equaliser filtered through, Inter missed two late chances to win the game. PSV, who had taken only one point from their first five matches in Group B, took the lead after 13 minutes when Hirving Lozano headed home Steven Bergwijn’s cross after Kwadwo Asamoah lost possession in defence. Inter looked nervous for much of the game, and the visitors withstood the pressure until Mauro Icardi headed in from Matteo Politano’s cross in the 73rd minute to leave the home fans in raptures. Their joy was short-lived, with Lucas’s strike reclaiming second spot for Spurs with just five minutes to go. Icardi was played through on goal at the death, but was denied by a brilliant tackle from PSV’s Nick Viergever.

They will now drop into the Europa League alongside Serie A rivals Napoli. “We didn’t keep the necessary tranquility, we got too nervous and we lost too many balls,” said Inter’s head coach, Luciano Spalletti. “We need the right mental strength to react to events such as the result of the Barcelona game ... We got carried away by the tension.” Borussia Dortmund won Group A after a 2-0 win at Thierry Henry’s Monaco meant they edged Atlético Madrid into second place, based on the two teams’ head-to-head record. Raphaël Guerreiro scored both goals as the Bundesliga leaders took advantage of Atlético’s unexpected goalless draw away to Club Brugge. Diego Simeone’s side could not find the goal that would have sealed top spot, and they now risk landing a tougher last-16 tie in Monday’s draw. The visitors struggled to make chances after Antoine Griezmann’s effort was saved in the first half, and the hosts nearly claimed a famous victory, substitute Luan Peres forcing a fine save from Jan Oblak in the 74th minute. Dortmund easily saw off Monaco despite resting several first-team regulars including Jadon Sancho, and extended their hosts’ winless run in Europe to 14 games. Portuguese winger Guerreiro finished a fine counter-attack with 15 minutes gone and sealed victory with a curling finish two minutes from time. In Group C, Paris Saint-Germain secured qualification and top spot in Group C with a 4-1 win over Red Star Belgrade amid a raucous atmosphere in Serbia. Liverpool and Napoli had previously left the Rajko Mitic Stadium without scoring, with Liverpool losing 2-0 and Napoli claiming a draw – but PSG broke through after just 10 minutes, Kylian Mbappé bursting clear and crossing for Edinson Cavani to finish. Neymar doubled the visitors’ lead on 40 minutes with a superb individual goal. Picking up the ball near the halfway line, the Brazilian sent one defender after another sprawling with lightning footwork, before stroking the ball past goalkeeper Milan Borjan. Roared on by more than 50,000 fans, Red Star pulled one back in the second half through Marko Gobeljic’s sumptuous volley. Thomas Tuchel’s side made sure of victory in the 74th minute, Marquinhos heading home Ángel di María’s inch-perfect free kick. Neymar then played Mbappé in to complete the rout in stoppage time. “We were on the back foot when Red Star scored, but we controlled the rest of the contest,” Tuchel said after the game. “We have the mentality required in the Champions League ... [but] we also have to stay humble and take it one match at a time. Our fans can dream of the title but we have to stay focused.” Both early kick-offs came in Group D, where Porto and Schalke had already sealed first and second place respectively. Porto edged a see-saw encounter in Turkey against Galatasaray, Sérgio Oliveira getting the winner as Sérgio Conceição’s side won 3-2 to finish the group with five wins and a draw. Alessandro Schöpf’s injury-time strike earned Schalke a 1-0 win over Lokomotiv Moscow.
