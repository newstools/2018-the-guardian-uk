Are you hooked on the look, character and aroma of a real Christmas tree? Then here’s our six-step guide how to pick the right one. • Step one: Pick it up and drop it on its stump from a few inches above ground. If more than a few needles drop, it has not been freshly cut. • Step two: Compare weights. In the trade, trees are sold wholesale as premium, standard and third grade. Premium trees are heavier, bushier and have a straight “leader” (the central stem at the top of the tree). • Step three: Don’t buy Norway spruces at the beginning of December: their needles drop early. But if you prefer to put up a tree closer to Christmas, a spruce should last the 12 days. • Step four: If you want an early tree, buy a Nordmann fir. The needles won’t drop. They cost more because they take about seven years to grow compared with five for a Norway spruce. • Step five: The big-box retailers aren’t that bad. B&Q is selling its medium Nordmann fir for £36, while Ikea is offering a £20 voucher to spend in its store if you buy its £25 tree, effectively cutting the cost to £5. The drawback is that the tree is only 4.5ft high. Aldi’s 5ft Nordmann fir is a bargain at £17.99, while Lidl is charging £19.99. Wyevale Garden Centres offers Nordmann firs at £30 for under 5ft, rising to £68 for a 7ft to 8.5ft tree. • Step six: Buy from a local grower if you can. The British Christmas Tree Growers Association website, bctga.co.uk, will show you where you can buy locally.
