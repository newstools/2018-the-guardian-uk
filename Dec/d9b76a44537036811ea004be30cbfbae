Would you like to speak to Marina Hyde, Gary Younge, Katharine Viner or Owen Jones? All four and many more of your favourite journalists will be staffing the 2018 Guardian and Observer charity telethon phone lines this Saturday to take your calls and donations. This year we are raising money for five brilliant charities that helped to expose the Windrush scandal and continue to help the thousands of people who have been tipped into poverty, homelessness and destitution by cruel hostile environment immigration policies. The Guardian and Observer editor-in-chief will also be joined on the phones by Polly Toynbee, Hadley Freeman, Jonathan Freedland, Sali Hughes, the Observer editor Paul Webster, Jess Cartner-Morley, John Crace and Peter Bradshaw. You can call from 10am to 6pm on 020 3353 4368. Or you can give online here. Your donations to the 2018 Guardian and Observer charity appeal will be shared between: Praxis Community Projects, Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Refugee and Migrant Centre Black Country and Birmingham, The Runnymede trust and Law Centres Network. As Viner said in her introduction to the appeal: “[The charities] provide legal assistance, advocacy and in some cases material and emotional support. Legal aid cuts mean they depend on public and philanthropic donations. They not only save lives and livelihoods; they help uphold our human and democratic rights.” The 2018 appeal runs until 7 January 2019.
