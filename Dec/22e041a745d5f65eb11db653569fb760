A robot-dancing Theresa May has been given the Saturday Night Live treatment after her political week to forget. The US late-night show, which often lampoons Donald Trump, turned its comedic lens on British politics for the sketch titled Happy Christmas, Britain. It opens with the prime minister, played by Kate McKinnon, busting her infamous dance moves alongside four gyrating police officers, before addressing the nation with a pained grin. “What a dreadful week it’s been. My Brexit deal is falling apart, I almost got voted out and no one in the world likes me at all. But it’s still Christmas, so let’s try to have some cheer tonight, shall we?” she says. She introduces a high-foreheaded and relaxed-looking David Cameron, played by Matt Damon, as “the man who called for the Brexit vote – then, when it passed, he bounced and left me to clean up his mess.” “You look well rested,” says May, and Cameron tells her he has just returned from a relaxing holiday in the Maldives. “You know what’s funny?” he says. “People hate me, but they really hate you. Even though I did Brexit. I mean, you’ve got to laugh.” The pair are then joined by Elton John, played by Aidy Bryant, who delivers a hamper of presents that all turn out to be faeces, and by Voldemort, “the one person in Britain more reviled than me”. McKinnon, who has impersonated Hillary Clinton, Justin Bieber and Angela Merkel on the show, spoke to the Guardian last year about her uncanny impression of May. “There’s a lot of things about her I found … endearing,” she said. “I found her cheerful, from afar. I don’t live there, so I’m not completely immersed in the nuances of the politics of the UK. But just as a speaking voice, I took delight in it.” The show also sent up the US president in a sketch that spoofed It’s a Wonderful Life, imagining how the world would look had Trump not stood for election.
