A Russian cargo ship has run aground off a Cornish beach. The 16,000-tonne Kuzma Minin was photographed before dawn grounded off Gyllyngvase beach near Falmouth. @BBCCornwall @Skentelbery getting busy with sightseers already. I am leaving now but people have to let the emergency services do their job. Please all people to stay off the beach.. pic.twitter.com/ylEgyE1Vex Boats from the Maritime and Coastguard and Falmouth lifeboat were at the scene. HM Coastguard plans to try to refloat the 180-metre carrier, which was listing at low tide. In a statement, the coastguard said the Kuzma Minin grounded at 5.40am after dragging its anchor during strong winds. It said: “She currently has a list of 5 degrees but there is no report of any pollution. Tugs are on their way to the vessel and a lifeboat is standing by at the scene. The Falmouth coastguard rescue team have cordoned off an area around the ship. “Tugs will be attached to the vessel and as the tide rises, the plan is to refloat the vessel.” The ship, which has 18 Russian crew on board but no cargo, was reported to have set off from the port of Terneuzen in the Netherlands. Ian Cocklin, a former sailor in the Royal Navy, tweeted pictures of the boat saying: “it’s huge and it’s close.” @BBCCornwall @Skentelbery it's huge and it's close.... pic.twitter.com/pldtJCrXTc The website Marine Traffic shows the position of the grounded vessel.
