Jürgen Klopp has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association over his celebratory pitch invasion in Sunday’s Merseyside derby. The Liverpool manager sprinted onto the Anfield pitch to embrace goalkeeper Alisson following Divock Origi’s dramatic 96th minute winner against Everton. He later admitted his reaction was “not cool” and claimed to have apologised to Marco Silva on the final whistle. The Everton manager countered there had been no apology from Klopp but he may have reacted the same under similar circumstances. Following receipt of referee Chris Kavanagh’s match report on Monday morning, the FA have charged the Liverpool manager and given him until Thursday to respond. Klopp could be fined, warned about his future behaviour or suspended depending if deemed guilty. A statement from the FA read: “Jürgen Klopp has been charged with misconduct relating to his behaviour in the 96th minute of the game between Liverpool and Everton yesterday. He has until 6pm on 6 December 2018 to respond to the charge.”
