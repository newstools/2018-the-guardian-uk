The Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette says he became involved in a confrontation with a fan after he was the target of a racial slur. The incident happened during the Jaguars’ game at the Tennessee Titans last Thursday. A video published by TMZ shows Fournette shouting “You’re too old for that” and “I’m gonna beat your ass” at the fan. Players can be disciplined for confrontations with fans but at his Monday press conference Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone said he believed there were extenuating circumstances. “I met with Leonard,” said Marrone. “He said there was a racial slur, so that’s what was told to me.” Marrone added no one else had mentioned the slur but said: “I trust the player.” Two members of the Jaguars walked Fournette away from the initial confrontation but the player could be seen continuing his argument with the member of the crowd from the team bench. Fournette has already been suspended once this season after he got into a fight with the Buffalo Bills’ Shaq Lawson in Week 12. Marrone said he had not considered disciplining Fournette over the latest incident. “That’s kind of a tough one, when it’s a racial slur, and that’s what the player tells you,” he said. It is not unknown for players to be the target of racial slurs in US sports. In 2017, the Baltimore Orioles’ Adam Jones said he had been called the n-word while playing the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. “I hope stadium security is involved,” Marrone said on Monday. “No one wants that stuff around this game.” Fournette was the fourth overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft and rushed for more than 1,000 yards in his first season. However, the Jaguars have struggled this season and Fournette missed six games through injury in a disappointing campaign.
