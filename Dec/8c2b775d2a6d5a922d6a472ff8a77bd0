In a season during which the Philadelphia Flyers’ new mascot, Gritty, has become a national icon one of the NHL’s veterans has reminded American he can still make an impact. The Chicago Sun-Times said police were called to the United Center on Friday night around 11pm after the Chicago Blackhawks mascot, Tommy the Hawk, was punched in the face and put in a headlock. As Tommy is flightless he was unable to reach a perch, eyrie or tree branch for safety. Tommy’s assailant was described as a white man between 18 and 20, about 5ft 5in and 160lbs. Video showed Tommy was able to struggle free from the headlock and bodyslam his small but nimble opponent to the floor.

A Blackhawks spokesperson said the team were aware of the incident. “We are gathering the facts and will have no further comment at this time, pending our investigation,” he said. Although generally kind to children and generous with free merchandise, mascots can lash out when provoked. In 2017, the New York Mets’ mascot, Mr Met, gave fans the middle finger after someone insulted his mother. “I do know that the fans were cursing at Mr Met with the f-word and saying derogatory things about Mr Met’s mom ... which led to the gesture because of a personal matter with his mom,” a witness told the New York post at the time.
