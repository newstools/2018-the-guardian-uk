Barack Obama has continued his tradition of publishing end-of-year lists, compiling the books, songs and films that the former US president has most enjoyed over the passed 12 months, with Zadie Smith, Beyoncé and Jay Z’s Apeshit and Armando Iannucci’s political satire The Death of Stalin all included. “As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing a favourite tradition of mine and sharing my year-end lists,” Obama wrote on Facebook, adding that the list included work that he found “thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved”. The lists – which started in 2015, while he was still in office – are meant to highlight work from famous and lesser-known writers, directors and musicians. In 2018, Obama read biographies including David W Blight’s study of Frederick Douglass, the anti-slavery advocate and intellectual (Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom) and tennis star Arthur Ashe: A Life by Raymond Arsenault. Max Tegmark’s cautionary examination of what human life might look like in a future with superintelligent AI, Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, was also included, as was fiction in the form of Florida by Lauren Groff. Obama started the tradition in 2015 when he released a playlist of the songs he’d been listening to, including artists such as the Isley Brothers, and Coldplay. He added book recommendations later that year, including Ta-Nehisi Coates’ celebrated book about race and America, Between the World and Me. In 2016, he recommended Pulitzer prize-winner Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad, as well as Paula Hawkins’ The Girl on the Train and H Is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald. This year’s film list was no less tasteful, with Palme d’Or winner Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters, sitting alongside Barry Jenkins’ James Baldwin adaptation, If Beale Street Could Talk and Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-tipped Roma. Alex Garland’s shapeshifting sci-fi Annihilation was also included, as was Ryan Coogler’s Marvel superhero epic Black Panther. Music was dominated by pop, rap and R&B. The backpacker hip-hop of J Cole, sat alongside rappers from Obama’s adopted hometown of Chicago in the form of Chance the Rapper and BJ the Chicago Kid. Irish singer Hozier found a space on the list as did indie darlings Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile. There was also a special mention of Nancy Wilson (one “the great jazz singers of all time”, according to Obama) who died in December. There was no place for Aretha Franklin, however.
