Chelsea will be forced to close part of Stamford Bridge in the Europa League if Uefa concludes their fans were guilty of an antisemitic chant in Budapest. The governing body hopes to receive on Friday reports which will enable it to decide whether to open a disciplinary case. Chelsea have strongly condemned a section of their fans for a chant which referenced “yids” in the Europa League game at Vidi but Uefa needs to take its own judgment. Uefa regulations state that the “club responsible is punished with a minimum of a partial stadium closure” if its supporters engage in behaviour which “insults the human dignity of a person or group of persons on whatever grounds, including skin colour, race, religion or ethnic origin”. Precedent indicates that if Chelsea fans are found guilty the club would be punished with a partial stadium closure for one Europa League match. The Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fàbregas said after the game in Hungary: “If we have to be taught a lesson at Chelsea to improve whatever happens around the world, then I’m happy. But to point the finger at one football club because of three or four of these people, I don’t think it’s deserved and I don’t agree with that.” Chelsea have said they will punish any fans “found to have shamed the club by using antisemitic or racist words or actions”. In their most recent home game there was alleged racist abuse of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling.
