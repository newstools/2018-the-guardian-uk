Unai Emery has suffered another injury blow with the Arsenal midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan ruled out until February with a foot injury. Mkhitaryan did not play in Saturday’s 3-1 win over Burnley and has been diagnosed with a fractured metatarsal in his right foot that will keep him out of action for six weeks. He was injured during the Carabao Cup defeat by Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium. Having lost the defender Rob Holding and the forward Danny Welbeck to season-ending injuries in November it is another setback for Emery. He is also without the defensive duo Shkodran Mustafi and Héctor Bellerín for the Boxing Day trip to Brighton, while Nacho Monreal is a doubt for that game but should be fit for Saturday’s trip to Premier League leaders Liverpool. Mkhitaryan has made 20 appearances in all competitions this season, scoring four times in the Premier League. After the trips to Brighton and Liverpool Arsenal, who are fifth behind Chelsea on goal difference, conclude their festive programme by hosting Fulham on New Year’s Day.
