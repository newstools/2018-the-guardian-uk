The Observer New Review’s picture editor recently discovered this previously unseen photograph by Jane Bown in the paper’s archives. It was taken in December 1962 at Witley station not far from Godalming in Surrey. Another photo from the same roll of film appeared on the front page of the paper on the first Sunday of that month. In that one, the Santa Claus was climbing into the first-class carriage of the London-bound train. The picture caption suggested that he was making an early start to the festive season in order to “avoid Dr Beeching’s railway closures” – the infamous plan to cull branch lines and local stations that transformed the network the following year. When she took these pictures, Jane Bown was only a decade into what became a 65-year career with this paper that only ended when she died aged 89 in 2014. Among those who paid tribute to her was Lord Snowdon, who described her as a “kind of English Cartier-Bresson”. This picture might be exhibit A in supporting Snowdon’s judgment. Bown was never without her camera, usually carried in a wicker shopping bag, and she lived for juxtapositions like this one. Her very English take on Cartier-Bresson’s “decisive moment” invariably involved the sharpest eye for the ironies of social class. The incongruities of off-duty Santas are familiar; her delight at this picture would have been in the supporting cast, however: the affable mustachioed man with his patched-up walking stick and, in particular, the look of aloof disquiet on the face of his daughter or grand-daughter, in her pony-club boots.
