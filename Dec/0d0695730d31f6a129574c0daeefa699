River Plate rejected the decision to play the rearranged second leg of their Copa Libertadores final against Boca Juniors in Madrid. The much anticipated Superclásico between the fierce Buenos Aires rivals was postponed twice last weekend after Boca’s team bus was attacked by River fans on the way to the stadium. On Thursday Conmebol announced the second leg of the final will be played at the Bernabéu stadium, more than 6,000 miles away from the original venue, on 9 December. But River Plate said in a statement on Saturday that it is “incomprehensible” to play it in Spain. “River Plate reject the change of venue,” the club said. “The club understands that the decision (to play in Madrid) … adversely affects those who bought tickets and also upsets the idea of equal conditions by taking away home advantage. “Argentine football as a whole and the Argentine Football Association cannot and should not allow a handful of violent [fans] to impede the Superclásico taking place in our country.”
