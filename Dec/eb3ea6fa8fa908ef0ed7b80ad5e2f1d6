Musical remake A Star is Born leads the way at this year’s Screen Actors Guild awards with four nominations while streaming hits Ozark and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel head up the small-screen side. Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper and Sam Elliott have all received nods for their work in the hit romance while the cast has also been recognised in the best ensemble category. They will face off against the casts of Black Panther, BlacKkKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody and Crazy Rich Asians. Gaga’s competition for best actress includes Glenn Close for her role in The Wife, Melissa McCarthy for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Emily Blunt for Mary Poppins Returns and Olivia Colman for The Favourite. The Yorgos Lanthimos-directed period comedy also scored nominations for Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone in the best supporting actress category. Cooper will face off against Rami Malek for his role as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, John David Washington for BlacKkKlansman, Viggo Mortensen for Green Book and Christian Bale for Vice. The Dick Cheney biopic also picked up a best supporting actress nomination for Amy Adams, who was also nominated for best actress in a TV movie or limited series for her performance in Sharp Objects. The small-screen categories were led by Netflix thriller Ozark and Amazon comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, both picking up four nominations. Other big-name nominees included Hugh Grant for his role in BBC’s A Very English Scandal, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin for Grace and Frankie and Penelope Cruz for playing Donatella Versace in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. Surprise snubs include no love for Amazon Prime’s acclaimed thriller series Homecoming and its star Julia Roberts, no nominations for Barry Jenkins’ James Baldwin adaptation If Beale Street Could Talk and big-screen ensemble shut-outs for The Favourite and Vice. Earlier this week, The Favourite garnered the most nominations at this year’s Critic’s Choice awards, scoring 14 in total. The Golden Globe nominations were led by Vice earlier this month. Last year’s SAG awards saw the cast of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri win the big prize for best ensemble with Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell also winning individual trophies. Next year’s ceremony will take place on 27 January.
