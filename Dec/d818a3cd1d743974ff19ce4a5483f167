A couple who were arrested and released without charge over the Gatwick drone incident have said they feel “completely violated” and are receiving medical care. Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk said in a statement outside their home in Crawley, West Sussex, that they had been “deeply distressed” by what they called their “disgusting” treatment in sections of the media, after they were detained in relation to the drone flights over the airport last week that brought it to a standstill. They were released after 36 hours of questioning. Their friends expressed dismay that the couple had been arrested in the first place. Their pictures appeared on a number of Sunday newspaper front pages, one of which asked: “Are these the morons who ruined Christmas?” The television presenter Piers Morgan apologised after describing the pair as “clowns” in a tweet and said the situation was a fiasco. Gait, who read out the statement, said: “Our home has been searched and our privacy and identity completely exposed. “Our names, photos and other personal information have been broadcast throughout the world. We are deeply distressed, as are our family and friends, and we are currently receiving medical care.” They said that they would not be commenting further and requested that their privacy be respected.
