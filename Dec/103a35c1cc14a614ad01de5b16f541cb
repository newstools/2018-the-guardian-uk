In Caspar David Friedrich’s famous painting Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog, a young man stands with his back to the viewer, looking out at a mountainscape, awed by the majestic beauty of nature. Tom Hunter’s Winterville is an inversion of that scene: the tree in the corner has been cut down, the mountain is a painted backdrop. Instead of being overwhelmed by nature, the figure at the centre is turning her back to it, despondent. The figure in question is a woman named Karolina Bajda; out of shot, to the right, is the bar where she worked late the night before. She was about to start another shift, her Santa outfit opposite her on the bench, when Hunter walked in and asked her to pose for a photo. The setting was Winterville, a winter fair held in Victoria Park, east London (it is now held in Clapham, south of the river); all around were fairground rides, a big wheel, more bars. To Hunter, the scene encapsulated many of the disparate elements that make up our Christmas celebrations: the pagan origins of tree worship, the Nordic tradition of Santa Claus, the glitzy modern decorations, the enduring ritual of drinking together. To the left, a cash machine frames the image: an altar to capitalism. The photo is part of Figures in a Landscape, a series in which Hunter, a professor at London College of Communication, explores myths and legends in modern settings. In this composition, he saw Aphrodite or Athena fallen to Earth from Mount Olympus after losing her place in the spiritual world. “I try to find the magic in the ordinary,” he says. “Not a magic which is just lovely, but one which has its demons and ghosts and spirits and history. I wanted to give the notion that there is this mythical landscape out there if you just look at it in the right way.” Winterville by Tom Hunter is available as a gallery edition from the Photographers’ Gallery, London. thephotographersgallery.org.uk
