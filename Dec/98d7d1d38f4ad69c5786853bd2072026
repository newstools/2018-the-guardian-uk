The Guardian is pleased to introduce its inaugural list of the best 100 female footballers in the world. In association with The Offside Rule Podcast we have assembled a panel of 72 judges from around the world to rate the players who have stood out in 2018. The panel includes experts such as the former Arsenal and England forward Kelly Smith, former USA internationals Tiffeny Milbrett and Kathryn Markgraf as well as leading managers such as Mark Parsons (Portland Thorns), Olivier Echouafni (Paris Saint Germain), Joe Montemurro (Arsenal) and Laura Harvey (Utah Royals). The Offside Rule has produced the list since 2016, but this is the first published in association with the Guardian. The countdown begins on Tuesday 4 December with Nos 100-71. On Wednesday we will reveal Nos 70-41, on Thursday Nos 40-11 before the top 10 on Friday completes this year’s list. Our 72 judges are drawn from around the world as follows: 34 from Europe, 14 from North and Central America, 11 from Asia, seven from South America, 11 from Asia, six from Africa. The Top 100 rules are explained beneath the list of judges.

We asked our judges to choose 40 names each, and rank their selections in order from 1-40, No 1 being their choice of the best female player in the world this year. The No 1 choice of each judge was awarded 40 point, No 2 given 39 points, down to 1 point for their 40th choice. All the votes were added together to give the final score. If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes is used as a tie-breaker. In the event individual votes were also level, the individual’s highest vote received is used as the next tie-breaker. The individual voting breakdown will be published when the full list has been revealed. We are very grateful to our judges for taking part and none have been paid for participating in this project. To allow our judges freedom to express their opinions without fear or favour, individual voting records will be anonymised in the full breakdown of scores. Voters are identified only by a number chosen at random. The judges’ number bear no relation whatsoever to the ordered list of judges’ names presented above.
