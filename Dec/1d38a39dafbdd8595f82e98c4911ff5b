Michael Avenatti, celebrity lawyer to Stormy Daniels and Trump antagonist, announced on Monday that he will not seek the presidency in 2020. “I do not make this decision lightly – I make it out of respect for my family,” Avenatti said in a statement posted to Twitter. “But for their concerns, I would run.” Avenatti represents Daniels, the adult film star and director, in her legal suits against Trump. He parlayed his newfound celebrity into openly considering a run for the Democratic nomination, making appearances in early-voting states such as Iowa and circulating a position paper. In the statement, the attorney warned that Democrats must put up an aggressive candidate and said many of the potential candidates are “not battle-tested and have no real chance at winning”. “We will not prevail in 2020 without a fighter,” said Avenatti. The announcement comes after Avenatti was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence against his now former girlfriend, actor Mareli Miniutti. The district attorney of Los Angeles declined to bring charges against Avenatti and referred the allegations to the city attorney for a possible misdemeanor case. Miniutti was granted a restraining order after accusing Avenatti of dragging her by the arm across a bedroom floor. Avenatti has called the allegations “completely false”. His announcement came the day after another potential contender for the Democratic nomination, former vice-president Joe Biden, told an audience in Montana he thought he was the “most qualified person” to be president. Biden also said the decision would be made with his family.
