My girlfriend and I went on holiday this summer and my dad turned up. I walked into the bathroom and there he was, in the mirror, watching me brush my teeth. I hadn’t been expecting him. Every so often, you get hit by the buildup of constant, tiny, drip-fed changes when they come together and create a seemingly sudden shift: opinions that drift to the point of reversal; the habits that form and unform. The face in the mirror was, of course, me. It wasn’t that I looked exactly like my dad: photographic evidence suggests he was considerably better looking than me in his late 20s, with a moustache so exquisite it could stop Indian traffic. I looked a bit like my dad. I looked a lot like a dad, a new dad, one who still feels too young for it, but knows he will have to try. That is how my dad must have felt when he looked similar. (How ridiculous to think he existed before me.) A few deaths in the family and coming off long-term antidepressant medication had already left me feeling indescribably older, a feeling that seemed to have written itself on to my face. From the four Hindu ashrama to Shakespeare’s monologue in As You Like It, various writers and belief systems have thought of life as a sequence of ages. I guess it is a way of making sense of this weird thing that feels so continuous and yet so distinct. I am sure my dad would think of his face in my mirror as my symbolic entry into the grihastha ashrama, the Hindu stage of life when one becomes a householder, marries and has a family. I would obvs 1bn per cent tell him to stop being such a nerdy poindexter bookworm with a hard-on for the Dharmaśāstra. I washed my face and walked out of the bathroom. Joy and I had a cup of tea. I don’t know what the next stage holds, but I know it has started.
