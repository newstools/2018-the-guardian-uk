Kelsey Lu is the strings svengali avant-pop performers such as Florence + the Machine and Solange have on speed dial. She played cello on the former’s recent High As Hope album and runs with the latter’s hip pack of musicians that includes Kelela, Blood Orange and Sampha, collaborating on tracks and supporting their live shows. You know that Lu has a unique star quality of her own, however, because she dances in her videos, doesn’t shave her armpits, and in interviews talks about dreaming she has a penis. Lu, 27, has been breaking out as a solo artist for the past two years, after dropping out of North Carolina School of the Arts and moving to New York (she’s now based in LA). Her 2016 debut EP Church was recorded live, in one take, at a Catholic church in Brooklyn, and introduced her as an alt-classical alchemist: loop-pedalled cello ballads that were billowy and bluesy, pastoral and glacial, stark but with a searing voice that could shatter stained glass. Her newest material, though, suggests that Lu is less freak-folk, more luxe dream-pop. April’s swoonsome single Shades of Blue is the closest Lu has got to a chorus so far; November’s Due West is one of those shape-shifting songs that pulls lush, clickety samples into a thicket of beats. Both are, presumably, part of the slow and steady buildup to an album – but Lu will, predictably, keep going at her own serene pace. Kelsey Lu plays the Roundhouse, London, on 8 March 2019
