Jürgen Klopp has welcomed the prospect of facing Bayern Munich as Liverpool were one of three English sides to be drawn against German opposition in the last 16 of the Champions League, while Manchester United face a monumental task to progress against Paris Saint-Germain. Klopp, who was manager of Borussia Dortmund when they were beaten by Bayern in the 2013 final at Wembley, will have the chance to avenge that defeat after Liverpool were paired with their fellow five-time winners at Monday’s draw. With Tottenham facing a tricky task against runaway Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund and competition favourites Manchester City matched with Schalke, the last 16 of Europe’s premier club competition will feature three Anglo-German showdowns for the first time. But despite having the advantage of a winter break for the last time with the Premier League set to introduce a two-week holiday next season, Klopp believes that will play no part in determining who reaches the quarter-finals. “The winter break doesn’t make a massive difference,” he said. “It makes only a massive difference with injuries and stuff like that, German clubs have the time, two or three weeks, to bring players back and stuff like that while in the same moment we have 10 games. But in February it should not have a massive influence.” On playing Bayern, against whom Klopp has lost 16 of the 29 matches he has taken charge of, he added: “It was clear it would be difficult [and] they are obviously a top side. For me it’s nice, going to Germany. It’s obviously long ago that I played Bayern in a competitive game, so I’m really looking forward to it.” The Bayern sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, believes the Germans face a “tough nut to crack” in tackling Liverpool. “Liverpool are the hottest team right now and top of the Premier League table,” he said. “They play good football, very physical and with a high tempo. We’re looking forward to playing there. These are the challenges you have to master in your career.” I 👀 u my former coach 😁 Bayern are currently third in the Bundesliga behind Lucien Favre’s Dortmund, who finished ahead of Atlético Madrid in their group and will also provide stiff opposition for Spurs to reach the last eight. As the only English side to finish top of their group, City were rewarded with what appears, on paper at least, to be the most straightforward task against Schalke. They have struggled in the league this season under 33-year-old coach Domenico Tedesco and must travel to the Etihad Stadium for the second leg on 12 March. “This competition is getting hard,” said City’s director of football, Txiki Begiristain. “There are big draws and big games coming. Teams that are struggling in their league have done very well in the Champions League. German clubs are always very dangerous.” Schalke v Manchester CityAtlético Madrid v JuventusManchester United v PSG Tottenham v Borussia Dortmund Lyon v Barcelona Roma v Porto Ajax v Real Madrid Liverpool v Bayern Munich United’s defeat in Valencia last week meant they missed the opportunity to finish ahead of Juventus in their group after the Italian champions were surprisingly beaten by Young Boys in the final match of the group stage. That ensured José Mourinho’s side entered Monday’s draw as one of the eight runners-up and they must now face a resurgent PSG side which beat Liverpool to top spot in Group C, with the first leg at Old Trafford on 12 February. PSG’s coach, Thomas Tuchel, has confidence in his Ligue 1 leaders, but warned against complacency. “We have the quality to win at Old Trafford. I’m confident for my team, but it’s a great test, a challenge,” he said. “The round of 16 is always tough. Manchester United have a lot of experience in this competition, which they’ve won several times. I’m neither satisfied nor unsatisfied by the draw.” Atlético will face Juventus in the pick of the other ties, while second favourites Barcelona were paired with Lyon, Roma face Porto and holders Real Madrid will take on Ajax. Uefa has confirmed the dates of the last-16 ties, which will see United host PSG on 12 February, with the second leg in France on 6 March. Spurs host Dortmund on 13 February and will play in Germany on 5 March. Liverpool’s first leg against Bayern will be at Anfield on 19 February, with the return fixture in the final set of games on 13 March. City head to Schalke on 20 February and are at home on 12 March.
