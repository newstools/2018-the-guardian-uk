There are two kinds of shoppers. The kind who never tire of cruising the aisles, bright-eyed, ever alert for the item that will finally transform their wardrobe, and their lives. And the kind who know deep in the well of their soul that there is no such thing as a bargain; those for whom even the thought of surveying another cheerless rack of shirts that will never look half as good once they get them home fills them with an existential torpor that seeps through every cell of their body and fills the sparking pathways of their brain with a slurry of Nietzschean despair. It is fair to say that the children in this picture by the Swedish photographer Lars Tunbjörk inhabit the latter category. They have come to the wrong place. They have found themselves in the third circle of shopping hell. Ullared is a village on the south-west coast of Sweden, with 791 inhabitants. It is also home to Gekås, the largest department store in Scandinavia. Gekås is visited annually by nearly 5 million customers, drawn by more than 100,000 bargains; it has a campsite and motel attached. The longest queue recorded at the superstore measured 1.4 km (close to a mile). Tunbjörk, who shared an interest in the extremes of the consumer experience with British photographer Martin Parr, took this picture as part of his series “I love Borås!”, a candid tribute to the suburban town in which he grew up. It is included in a posthumous collection of the photographer’s work published this month. Ullared, synonymous in Sweden with the word “bargain”, is an hour’s drive from Borås. The average shopper at Gekås has travelled 150km to get there. Lars Tunbjörk is published by Max Ström (£50)
