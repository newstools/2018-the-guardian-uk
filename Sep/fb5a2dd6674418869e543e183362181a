Footage posted on social media shows audience members being forcefully removed from Dua Lipa’s performance in Shanghai on 12 September. Users claim that fans were targeted for dancing in their seats and waving flags in support of gay rights. The videos show security staff pulling people from their seats, and crowd members apparently being attacked by security guards outside the National Exhibition and Convention Center in the city’s Qingpu district. I just CANT believe it. This is the show of Dua Lipa in Shanghai. All the fans are forbidden to stand out and could only sit on to see the show?!? If you don’t, the guard would use violence to kick u out. It’s unbelievable... #dualipa pic.twitter.com/quITZNLVxU The English-Albanian singer appeared upset on stage. “I want to create a really safe environment for us all to have fun,” she said towards the end of the concert. “I want us all to dance. I want us all to sing. I want us all to just have a really good time.” The BBC reports that heavy-handed crowd control isn’t uncommon in China. The country decriminalised homosexuality in 1997, but LGBTQ-related content has recently been censored from social media platform Weibo. The Shanghai date was part of Lipa’s first tour of China. She performed in Guangzhou on 11 September. Electricity, Lipa’s single with Mark Ronson and producer Diplo’s group Silk City, is expected to be in the UK Top 20 on Friday. Lipa has not since spoken about the incident. The Guardian has contacted the singer’s representatives for comment.
