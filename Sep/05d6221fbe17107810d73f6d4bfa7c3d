An unnamed member of the Saudi royal family has reported the theft of hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of jewellery from her suite at the Ritz hotel in Paris. The princess, who was not named by police, claimed jewels worth around €800,000 (£713,000) disappeared on Friday afternoon. Police said the jewels were not in a safe in the room and there was no sign of forced entry to the suite at the celebrated hotel in Place Vendôme. An investigation has been opened by France’s organised crime brigade. It is the second time the luxury hotel has been struck by thieves in the space of less than a year. In January, an armed gang made off with around €4m worth of jewels from shops inside the newly renovated Ritz in a spectacular raid. The commando group stormed the hotel using axes to smash display cases containing jewellery and watches, but dropped their haul while trying to escape. All the missing items were eventually recovered.
