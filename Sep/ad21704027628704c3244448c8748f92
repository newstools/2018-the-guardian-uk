José Mourinho has told Paul Pogba he will never captain Manchester United again, in a move made by the manager to underline his authority at the club. Pogba had been given the armband by Mourinho for three matches this season in the absence of Antonio Valencia. But it is understood the manager has informed the Frenchman this will not occur again because of his unhappiness with the player. The midfielder has performed erratically this term and, after the 1-1 draw with Wolves at Old Trafford on Saturday, seemed to question Mourinho’s tactics, stating United should “attack, attack, attack” more. While these are the words of a popular fans’ chant, this followed Pogba saying earlier in the season he would be fined for saying certain things. The move from Mourinho is the latest fracture in his relationship with Pogba and calls into doubt the 25-year-old’s long-term future at the club.
