Alastair Cook broke the news of retirement from international cricket to his England teammates as they celebrated Sunday’s series victory over India in Southampton, with tributes then pouring in after the news became public the next day. The 33-year-old will start the 161st and final Test match of his record-breaking career at the Oval on Friday in what will doubtless be a congratulatory send-off after admitting, amid a personal struggle for runs this summer, that “there is nothing left in the tank”. Cook is expected to receive a pre-match presentation from both the England hierarchy and Joe Root, who succeeded him as Test captain in February last year, before the chance to add to his 12,254 runs - the sixth most in Test history – and 32 centuries. The four-time Ashes winner has pledged to play on for his county, Essex, next season and it was fitting that Graham Gooch, his old mentor and the batsman whose England Test record of 8,900 runs was passed in 2015, was at the forefront of the reaction. Gooch said: “Alastair has been the rock of England’s batting for the last 12 years since he made his debut – and while we are all sad to see him retire, we must rejoice in what he has done for our country. He is a genuine legend of English cricket. “He is a legend not only because of his performances, but because of his attitude, his sacrifices, the way he has carried himself and the example he has set. Alastair is a perfect role model and is the image of the game we want to project. He is a great ambassador for his sport; he is a great person as well as a great cricketer.” 12,254 Alastair Cook (average 44.88) 8,900 Graham Gooch (42.58) 8,463 Alec Stewart (39.54) 8,231 David Gower (44.25) 8,181 Kevin Pietersen (47.28) 26,086 Alastair Cook (England) 17,806 Hashim Amla (South Africa) 15,554 Kumar Sangakkara (Sri Lanka) 14,165 Ian Bell (England) 13,987 AB de Villiers (South Africa) 32 Alastair Cook 23 Kevin Pietersen 22 Ian Bell, Geoffrey Boycott, Colin Cowdrey, Wally Hammond 11 Alastair Cook 10 Wally Hammond, Len Hutton, Kevin Pietersen 8 Dennis Amiss, Graham Gooch, David Gower 11,627 Alastair Cook (England) 9,607 Sunil Gavaskar (India) 9,030 Graeme Smith (South Africa/World XI) 8,625 Matthew Hayden (Australia) 8,207 Virender Sehwag (India/World XI) NB Cook scored 627 Test runs batting at No3 or No7 160 Alastair Cook 142 Jimmy Anderson 133 Alec Stewart 122 Stuart Broad 118 Ian Bell, Graham Gooch 158 Alastair Cook (England, 2006-18) 153 Allan Border (Australia, 1979-94) 107 Mark Waugh (Australia, 1993-2002) 106 Sunil Gavaskar (India, 1975-87) 101 Brendon McCullum (New Zealand, 2004-16) 2,710 Alastair Cook (England, average 53.13) 2,058 Jacques Kallis (South Africa, 55.62) 1,889 Ricky Ponting (Australia, 41.97) 1,859 Hashim Amla (South Africa, 47.66) 1,850 Shivnarine Chanderpaul (West Indies, 48.68) 294 Highest Test score, against India in 2011. 766 Runs scored in the 2010-11 Ashes, when England won in Australia for the first time in 24 years. 173 Catches taken in Test cricket, the most by an England outfielder. 59 Tests as captain, another England record. 562 Runs scored in four Tests against India in 2012-13, his first series as full-time captain. England won a series in India for the first time in 28 years. 15 Opening partners in his career: Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan, Michael Carberry, Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Nick Compton, Joe Root, Sam Robson, Adam Lyth, Moeen Ali, Alex Hales, Ben Duckett, Haseeb Hameed, Keaton Jennings, Mark Stoneman. 1 Test wicket: Ishant Sharma at Trent Bridge in 2014. 46.57 Cook’s average as captain. When he was in the ranks he averaged 43.84. 46.97 Cook’s career strike rate per 100 balls – faster than, among others, Graham Thorpe, Robin Smith, Jacques Kallis, Faf du Plessis and Nasser Hussain. 18.62 Cook’s average in 2018, easily his lowest in a calendar year. Among his current teammates, Stuart Broad tweeted: “Not enough words to describe what a legend Cooky is” while Jonny Bairstow added: “A true legend who set the benchmark on and off the pitch. It’s been an honour playing alongside you. Congratulations on a stellar England career.” Eoin Morgan, who succeeded him as one-day captain in late 2014, tweeted: “Our GOAT. What he has achieved at 33 years young is incredible. Thanks chef.” As well as leading England a record 59 times in Test cricket, including 24 wins, Cook will be remembered for the unstinting bloody-mindedness that began with scores of 60 and 104 not out on his debut in Nagpur in 2006 and then ran through his career like words in a stick of rock. The highlights include his 766 runs and three centuries as England, for the first time in 24 years, won an Ashes series in Australia in 2010-11, and captaining England to a 2-1 victory in India the following winter when he again dominated with the bat. From that era, his former wicketkeeper Matt Prior, tweeted: “England will lose not only an outstanding player but an outstanding human being who gave everything for his team & teammates.” Graeme Swann added: There is a reason why he has lasted so long. He always put in 100% but would look and appreciate the other side of life.” There have been five double-centuries along the way, the last of which came in December with an unbeaten 244 against Australia in Melbourne. In 10 Test innings this summer, however, he has averaged 22 and though tempted to end on a high in next year’s bid to regain the Ashes, the left-hander has decided enough is enough. His wife, Alice, who has been a source of strength during the tougher times – such as his fallow year in 2014 amid fallout from the Kevin Pietersen saga and the end of four-year captaincy tenure - is also expecting their third child imminently. As well as thanking the Barmy Army and England’s supporters as a whole, Cook’s retirement statement added: “Although it is a sad day, I can do so [retire] with a big smile on my face knowing I have given everything and there is nothing left in the tank. “I have achieved more than I could have ever imagined and feel very privileged to have played for such a long time alongside some of the greats of the English game. The thought of not sharing the dressing room, again, with some of my teammates was the hardest part of my decision, but I know the timing is right.” Joe Denly could be the chief beneficiary of Cook’s retirement with a spot on the winter tour to Sri Lanka, while Moeen Ali is expected to be handed the chance to stake his claim for the much-debated No 3 position at the Oval this week. Denly, the 32-year-old Kent right-hander who made the last of 14 limited-overs appearances for England eight years ago, is known to be among the frontrunners to open this winter although is unlikely to be included when the squad for Friday’s dead-rubber fifth Test with India is named on Tuesday. England are instead leaning towards giving Keaton Jennings another opportunity following an encouraging second-innings 36 during the 60-run win in Southampton, and, in a continuation of a mid-Test switch, Moeen should remain at first drop, allowing the captain, Joe Root, to bat his preferred No 4 position permanently. Trevor Bayliss has always advocated Root coming in a spot higher but, after seeing him average 29 there this summer, now accepts it has not worked. The coach said: “I thought it was for the best of the team he batted at No 3. Hopefully we can find someone who can do a decent job there and he can bat where he feels most comfortable. All credit to him. He has taken that role on with no problems. He has taken one for the team in that respect.” Moeen is desperate for another chance in the spot he bats for his county, Worcestershire, and could well see this extend into the winter against Sri Lanka and West Indies owing to the reduced threat of the new ball and his ability against the turning ball. Bayliss said: “In the right conditions I would not put [batting at No 3] past him. He works hard at his game.” While 3-1 up in the series, England are unlikely to make too many changes for the fifth Test. Much will depend on the ability of Ben Stokes to bowl – the all-rounder is struggling with a knee injury but has been told surgery is not required – and so this and the Oval pitch could dictate whether Chris Woakes returns in place of Adil Rashid, a move that would see Moeen as the solitary spinner. Jos Buttler is likely to continue behind the stumps, meaning Jonny Bairstow remains as a specialist batsman. But the pair will also face a challenge for the overseas trips from Surrey’s Ben Foakes, who is considered the superior gloveman. Rory Burns, the Surrey captain who is the leading scorer in Division One this year, is considered behind him in the pecking order and much will depend on how Jennings fares in his final chance to impress.
