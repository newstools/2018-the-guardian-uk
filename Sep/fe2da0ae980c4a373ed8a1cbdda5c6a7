The Italian sneaker brand Golden Goose has come under heavy criticism across the internet this week as images of their Superstar Taped Sneaker have circulated. The sneaker, the latest example of the “distressed fashion” trend, is designed to appear worn and beaten up. “Crumply, hold-it-all-together tape details a distressed leather sneaker in a retro low profile with a signature sidewall star and a grungy rubber cupsole,” reads the description of the sneaker, for sale at Nordstrom for $530. Many online have accused the brand of fetishizing poverty, pointing out the cruel irony in people being able to afford such expensive sneakers while so many others are forced to wear their own until they fall apart without being able to think of it as a fashion statement. “There are people in the world wearing plastic bags as shoes because they can’t afford any but these HIDEOUS things are selling for $500 the fashion industry is truly so fucking stupid it pisses me off like what the actual hell ??????!” wrote one offended Twitter user. “I think peak capitalism is selling shoes characteristic of those who can’t afford new ones for $530,” added a second. This isn’t the first time Golden Goose has provoked the ire of critics online. In 2016, an uproar emerged with the launch of a similar style of sneakers fashioned with a piece of duct tape across the toe that retailed for $585. Lmao wait one minute pic.twitter.com/o97SzUqynI Golden Goose has yet to comment on the reception the sneakers have gotten this time out, but two years ago the company released a statement about the issue. The company said it was “proud to highlight its pioneering role in the booming of the distressed look, one of the current biggest trends in fashion”, adding that the taped look on the sneakers was meant to “pay homage to the West Coast’s skater culture”. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2016 estimates, 43.1 million Americans lived in poverty that year.
