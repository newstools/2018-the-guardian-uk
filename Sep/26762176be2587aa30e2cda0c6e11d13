It was quite the send off for Wesley Sneijder. The 34-year-old – making the last of his Netherlands appearances on Thursday – sat with his family in a makeshift living room, constructed in the middle of the pitch in the Johan Cruyff Arena after the friendly against Peru, and enjoyed some of his career highlights. There are many in an orange shirt, from being named in the team of the tournament at Euro 2008 to helping the Netherlands to the World Cup final in 2010 to captaining his country to a third-placed finish four years later in Brazil. In total there were 31 goals in 134 appearances – nobody has made more for the Netherlands. He played 62 minutes against Peru and went off to a standing ovation after helping the Netherlands to draw level following Pedro Aquino’s opening goal for the visitors in the 13th minute. Memphis Depay scored both goals for the Dutch, who ran out 2-1 winners. Portugal defender Pepe celebrated his 100th cap by heading the equaliser to give his side a 1-1 draw against World Cup runners-up Croatia in a friendly. Croatia took the lead in the 18th minute when forward Ivan Perisic, one of five members of their starting line-up who played in the World Cup final against France, fired home a loose ball after it ricocheted around the Portugal defence. Brazilian-born Pepe, handed the captaincy for the match with Cristiano Ronaldo rested, levelled 14 minutes later with a thumping header from Pizzi’s cross. Manchester City’s Oleksandr Zinchenko came off the bench to strike a late goal as Ukraine snatched a 2-1 victory over the Czech Republic in their Nations League opener. It looked like the Group 1 contest was heading towards a draw until Zinchenko tapped a cross into an empty net with seconds remaining. The Czech team had taken an early lead through Patrik Schick but Yevhen Konoplyanka pulled Ukraine level just before the break.
