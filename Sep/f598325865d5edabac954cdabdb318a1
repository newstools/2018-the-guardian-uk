The first trailer for Captain Marvel has been launched on the internet. Starring Brie Larson, Captain Marvel is the first female superhero movie from the Marvel conveyor belt: it features ex-pilot Carol Danvers who gains superpowers after an accident and joins an intergalactic team called Starforce. Captain Marvel is directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck â€“ another left-field choice by Marvel, as the pair were previously known for small scale indie films such as Half Nelson, baseball movie Sugar, and gambling drama Mississippi Grind. Captain Marvel also features Samuel L Jackson in his regular Marvel role of Nick Fury, while Ben Mendelsohn plays the main baddie, an alien called Talos who is leading an invasion of Earth. Captain Marvel is due for release on 7 March in Australia, and 8 March in the UK and US.
