The casting of Jodie Whittaker as the first female Doctor Who has not just transformed a Time Lord into a Time Lady, but has also seemingly regenerated a Mr Man into a Little Miss. Penguin Random House has announced that later this year Dr Thirteenth will join its range of stories that mashup the world of the Mr Men with the universe of Doctor Who. Like all the stories in the Doctor Who Mr Men series so far, it has been written and illustrated by Adam Hargreaves, the son of Roger Hargreaves, who asked his father “Daddy, what does a tickle look like?”, and thus inspired the creation of the whole Mr Men series in 1971, back when Jon Pertwee was playing the Doctor on TV. The new book, already available to preorder, is scheduled for release on 6 November. Preview pages show the new Doctor alongside the three companions who will appear as her friends in her debut season: Yasmin, Ryan and Graham, played on-screen respectively by Mandip Gill, Tosin Cole and Bradley Walsh. The story centres around what the Doctor, Ryan and Graham are going to get for Yasmin’s birthday, which turns into an explosive surprise. There will be a limited edition hardback cover version of the book, but the regular paperback will sit happily alongside the Mr Men and Little Miss books that have been a bedtime story staple for decades. The Doctor Who Mr Men books launched in 2017, and have since included special Christmas adventures. Collectable figurines from the series have also been produced. The BBC is yet to confirm when the new series of Doctor Who will air – although there was speculation this week that the date will be Sunday 7 October, after reports that the iTunes store in Germany briefly displayed the launch date.
