The American rockers Paramore have retired their breakthrough smash Misery Business from their live shows, owing to frontwoman Hayley Williams’ discomfort with the slut-shaming lyrics (“Once a whore, you’re nothing more)” penned when she was 17. However, pop has a long, dishonourable lineage of songs that now sound unfortunate or offensive. Here are some examples: “She was just 17/ If you know what I mean.” We do. Not Fab. Whisper it, but even the hallowed Beasties once portrayed women as domestic/sexual servants. Surprisingly, perhaps defiantly, this politically incorrect 1966 song about subordinating a “squirmin’ dog of a girl” remains in their setlist. 1986 smash filled with political incorrectness (“I don’t want no seven stone weakling/ Or a boy who thinks he’s a girl”) and still widely played in gyms. In 2018, is it big or clever for Allen to ridicule her ex’s penis? Still a local radio staple, Gazza confesses to underage carnal desires. “Have a drink, have a drive …”. Hip-hop’s litany of offence plumbs the depths. Few songs are as offensive as GNR’s 1988 rant about “immigrants and faggots”. Co-songwriter Carole King now disowns husband Gerry Goffin’s 1962 lyrics, inspired by babysitter Little Eva’s justification for a boyfriend’s abuse. The now reliably woke, Sir Elt once asked “Island girl, what you wanting with the white man’s world?” and adopted cod patois. A fine 70s power-pop hit about masturbation. Great! Apart from Asian stereotyping. The outcast Leader’s paedophilia convictions make this 1980 single particularly uncomfortable. The “I Kissed A Girl” singer uses “gay” as an insult and adds: “You don’t even like boys.” Covered by June Carter and Michael Buble, a 1944 song with allusions towards date rape.
