I am a 71-year-old woman with an appetite for sex some people would consider inappropriate for my age. This is a complete change from how I was as a young woman. During my early life, the quick “in-and-out” I experienced put me off sex, and my quest for love seemed more important. It was only in later life that I loosened up and discovered there is much more to it. I feel my sexuality is an important part of my identity, although it has been a struggle for me to overcome the sexual repression that came from my upbringing. During the 1960s and 70s, the idea of sexual liberation was everywhere, but I remained prudish despite being fascinated by sex. Eventually, I sought therapy, which gave me a new confidence. I have been pleasantly surprised by the generosity of men I have known, and impressed by their knowledge and skill in giving me pleasure. I married late and our relationship has given me the closeness and affectionlacking in my childhood. It was love at first sight and the sexual chemistry between us was amazing. Initially, I found it difficult to know exactly what I wanted sexually, due to my limited experience. Although I was open-minded and adventurous, it took me some years to become more relaxed and spontaneous. I think of sex as a grown-up form of play and recognise there are many ways of getting sexual pleasure. I have been married for 25 years. Any lingering feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment have disappeared, and I am able to satisfy my sexual needs through intercourse, masturbation and fantasy. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.
