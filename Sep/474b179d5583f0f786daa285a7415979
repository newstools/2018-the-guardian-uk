Wolfsburg have terminated the contract of English forward Kaylen Hinds after the former Arsenal player went awol from the German club for a number of weeks. The 20-year-old is now a free agent. “Wolfsburg has parted with Kaylen Hinds,” Wolfsburg said. “The club has reacted to the forward’s unauthorised absence of several weeks by terminating his contract with immediate effect. There is no longer a valid contract of employment between Hinds and VfL.” The club’s sporting director Jörg Schmadtke also expressed his dismay at the player, who came through the youth academy at Arsenal but left for Wolfsburg in 2017 without making a first team appearance for the Premier League side. “Despite repeated requests, he has not fulfilled his contractual obligations,” Schmadtke said. “We do not tolerate such behaviour.” Hinds made one Bundesliga appearance and one Germany Cup appearance for Wolfsburg and was on loan at second-division side Greuther Fürth earlier this year between January and June 2018. He has represented England at various youth levels, including the under-20s last year.
