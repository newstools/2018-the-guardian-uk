A juicy watermelon is a joy in summer: thirst-quenching, sweet and cooling. Its shape and colour are a universally recognised symbol, an emoji for hot weather and good times. Shops in my local high street display dozens of these green, tiger-printed fruits, some cut into ginormous wedges, all jolly-rancher-red and flecked with black pips. They reach astronomical sizes, commonly weighing in at more than 6kg, the size of a small Space Hopper, although much less bouncy. Once cut, watermelon keeps for just a few days in the fridge, but luckily it’s about much more than just eating as is: mix cubes of flesh with feta and mint to make an unusual salad; blend with lime juice for a revitalising drink (and add a touch of vodka, if it’s that time of day); or make today’s moreish pickle. The rind is usually discarded, but it’s a wonderful ingredient in its own right. In fact, it’s the star of my new favourite pickle: a sweet-sour condiment that goes with all sorts – it’s mindblowing in a cheddar sandwich, spooned beside a curry or used to top tacos. Take 400g watermelon rind with a little flesh still attached, peel off the hard skin and cut into 3cm pieces. Put 275ml water, 100ml vinegar, a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, four teaspoons of salt and 100g sugar in a saucepan, bring to a boil, add the rind, return to a boil and turn off the heat. Fill a clean jam jar with the pickled watermelon and juice, top with a few slices of green chilli and screw on the lid. They’re ready to eat once cooled, and will keep in the fridge for a month or longer.
