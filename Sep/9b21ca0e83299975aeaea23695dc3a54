Police in northern Thailand have arrested three men over the murder of a British millionaire and his wife. Alan Hogg, 64, who is from Edinburgh, and his Thai wife Nod Suddaen, 61, were reported missing from their home in the Phrae province on Thursday after they failed to meet friends in the nearby city of Chang Mai. Blood stains were found in the sink and changing room area around the pool at their home, with signs they had been wiped down, but no bodies have been found. A mobile phone belonging to Suddaen was still charging at the house when police arrived to search the property. On Tuesday morning, police confirmed they had arrested three men who officers said had admitted killing the couple and burying their bodies away from the house. Police General Sanpat Prabpudsa, who was leading the investigation, said: “We have arrested three men who have confessed.” He said the police believed the crime was linked to an ongoing family dispute the couple had with Hogg’s brother-in-law, Warut Satchakit, who lived locally. “The brother-in-law had problems with money and there were family issues,” he said. The police said the three men arrested over the murders had informed them where the bodies were buried and that they would be recovered on Tuesday. Prabpudsa said: “We know the spot they are buried, I think we can find the bodies today.” Police arrested Satchakit on Monday after CCTV footage showed him entering the couple’s home on Thursday morning and driving away their car. He was released on bail and has since disappeared. A recently-dug hole was also found near to the couple’s house which had then been filled in, though no bodies were recovered. Hogg, who worked as an engineer and a businessman, had moved to Thailand several years ago and built the luxury three-story home in Phrae province, which included a swimming pool, summer house and cattle yard. The couple’s daughter Robyn flew to Thailand from the UK over the weekend to assist the search.
