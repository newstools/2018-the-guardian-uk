Pep Guardiola has revealed Benjamin Mendy has an injured fifth metatarsal, with Manchester City’s manager unsure how long the left-back will be out. The 24-year-old has missed the past two games. It is understood the problem is bruising in the left foot and minor. Guardiola, asked for how long Mendy would be unavailable, said: “I don’t know it – he has a problem in his bone.” Guardiola welcomed the news that Sergio Agüero had signed a one-year contract extension to stay City until 2021. If the striker sees out the deal it would mean he will have been at City for a decade, having joined from Atlético Madrid in summer 2011. The 30-year-old has scored three goals in six appearances this season and has drawn praise from Guardiola for his all-round game, an area the manager has been keen for Agüero to improve. “I am so happy he has signed a new contract and can stay 10 years at the club,” Guardiola said. The sentiment from Agüero, City’s all-time leading goalscorer, was similar. “My idea was being here for 10 years,” he said. “I’ve been here for seven years, it’s going to be 10 when the contract expires. This was the main reason I signed. I’m very happy because they have treated my very well since the first day I got here.” City suffered a surprise 2-1 home defeat to Lyon in Wednesday’s opening Champions League group game. Yet Guardiola defended his team, saying they were not required to say sorry. “The players don’t have to apologise,” he said. “Why should they? They ran, they fought, tried to make a comeback. The competition punishes the mistakes. We made a lot of mistakes. But they don’t have to apologise.”
