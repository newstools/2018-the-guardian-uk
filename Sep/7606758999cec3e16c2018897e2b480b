Unseeded John Millman produced the performance of his career to end Roger Federer’s interest in the 2018 US Open with a stunning 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (3) victory in the small hours at Flushing Meadows. Millman, ranked 55 in the world, capitalised on some sloppy serving from an under-par Federer to secure victory with the time approaching 1am in New York and move into a quarter-final clash with another former US Open winner, Novak Djokovic. “I’m probably in a little bit of disbelief,” said Millman. “I have so much respect for Roger and everything he’s done for the game. He’s been a hero of mine and today he was definitely not at his best. But I’ll take it.” More to follow.
