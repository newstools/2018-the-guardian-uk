The Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami has withdrawn from Sweden’s alternative to the Nobel prize for literature, citing a wish to concentrate on his writing. Established in the wake of the sexual assault scandal that led to the postponement of this year’s literature prize, the New Academy Prize set out to be a “reminder that literature should be associated with democracy, openness, empathy and respect”. Backed by more than 100 Swedish cultural figures, it shortlisted four authors for the award, with Murakami up against the British fantasy author Neil Gaiman, Guadeloupean novelist Maryse Condé and the Vietnam-born Canadian author Kim Thúy. The intention was that an expert jury would announce their winner in October. But the award organisers have revealed that when the final four authors were notified, Murakami asked for his nomination to be withdrawn. The Japanese novelist is frequently seen as a frontrunner for the Nobel itself, which is hoping to unveil two winners in 2019 once it has restored what it described as “reduced public confidence” following the scandal. The New Academy said in a statement that Murakami had emailed them saying that it was a great honour to be shortlisted. But “Murakami then said his preference is to concentrate on his writing, away from media attention … The New Academy regrets but respects his decision.” According to the organisers, the three remaining candidates have “all expressed enthusiasm for their nomination for the prize”. Gaiman has previously tweeted that: “Winning would not make me any happier than being on that list makes me. So I don’t think of it as being up against opponents, just as being in glorious and honoured company.”
