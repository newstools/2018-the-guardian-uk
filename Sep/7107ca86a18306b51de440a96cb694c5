Manchester United earned record revenues of £590m though the Glazers’ debt from buying the club 13 years ago stands at nearly half a billion, according to the latest financial results. The borrowings of the 20-times champions remain at £487m despite the American family having purchased United in 2005 for a debt of £525m. This means that less than £3m a year has been paid off since, with the cost of serving the debt amounting to £24m a year. Yet the £590m revenue places United ahead of Manchester City as the most successful club in these terms, with the champions’ recently published results showing £500.5m. United last claimed the title in May 2013 and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, focused on the drive for silverware when discussing financial results which run to June 2018. “We are the biggest sports team in the world. That requires continued investment. Our aim is to win trophies, it is one of the reasons we hired José Mourinho,” Woodward said. “Everyone at the club is working tirelessly to add to Manchester United’s 66 and José’s 25 trophies. That is what our passionate fans and our history demands. We are committed to our philosophy of blending top academy graduates with world-class players and are proud that, once again, last season we had more academy graduate minutes on the pitch than any other Premier League club. “Our increased revenue expectation for the year demonstrates our continued strong long-term financial performance which underpins everything we do and allows us to compete for top talent in an increasingly competitive transfer market.” While broadcasting revenue was £204.1m, up 10.1% on the prior year primarily due to “finishing runners up compared to sixth” the previous season, overall commercial revenue rose only £0.6m to £276.1m.
