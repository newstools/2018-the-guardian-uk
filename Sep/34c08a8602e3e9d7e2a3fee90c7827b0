Dave Heath took this picture in Chicago in 1956, the year that Martin Luther King Jr first spoke at the city’s university about the injustices of segregation: “This is a conflict between the forces of light and dark, and in the end there will be victory for justice and democracy because love will triumph!” Heath himself had not long returned from a different conflict, the Korean war, where he had seen two years’ service as a machine gunner alongside Americans of all races. He had a camera with him in the army camp and used it to capture his fellow soldiers in private thought. When he came home, he employed that same eye on city streets and subways. Over the course of a decade, Heath built up a body of work, which he published as one of the most celebrated photographic books of the 1960s: A Dialogue With Solitude. One section of that book, which focused on African Americans, included this picture of a woman on a street corner. He prefaced it with a quote from the writer James Baldwin: “It is a terrible, an inexorable law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one’s own.” In creating his book, Heath, who died in 2016, used then unconventional darkroom methods he had learned from Life magazine photographers including W Eugene Smith. He burned and bleached his prints to fix the viewer’s attention on the elements that carried the emotion, in this case the figure of the woman and the slogans written on the window panes. He sought connection in his pictures, but also acknowledged the loneliness that had defined him since being abandoned by his parents aged four, and having spent his childhood in orphanages and foster homes. When A Dialogue with Solitude first appeared, fellow photographer Robert Frank described its mood as “late Friday afternoon in the universe”. Dave Heath: Dialogues with Solitudes, the first major exhibition of Heath’s work in France, is at Le Bal, Paris, Friday-23 December
