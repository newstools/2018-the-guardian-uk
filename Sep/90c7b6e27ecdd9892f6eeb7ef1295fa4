After an election that drew the eyes of the world on Sunday, Sweden faces a period of political uncertainty, with a new government not expected to form for weeks. The two main parliamentary blocs were left tied but well short of a majority and the far-right Sweden Democrats are promising to wield “real influence” in parliament despite making more modest gains than many had predicted. If you voted in Sweden’s 2018 elections we’d like to hear from you. How did you cast your ballot and why? Did you vote based on issues such as immigration, crime or the economy?
