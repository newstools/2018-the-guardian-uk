A film based on the day-to-day life of Harvey Weinstein’s personal assistant is in the works, one of a flood of projects about the disgraced former movie mogul. According to the Hollywood Reporter, a script for the film is being shown to potential buyers at the Toronto film festival. A statement from the production company says that the film’s writer-director Kitty Green (previously responsible for avant-garde documentary Casting JonBenét) researched “hundreds of public records and documents, and [conducted] scores of interviews … [and] has distilled and invented a wholly original vision of just one day in the life of an imagined entry-level worker”. Weinstein was charged in New York with “rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct” in connection with two women, and one of “predatory sexual assault” against a third. Police investigations in Los Angeles and London are ongoing. Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sexual activity. In February 2018, Weinstein’s former personal assistant Sandeep Rehal launched legal action against the producer, alleging she was “required to be involved in and aware of the preparations for, and clean up after, Harvey Weinstein’s extremely prolific sexual encounters”. Weinstein denies all the allegations. The project is being overseen by producer-director James Schamus, who as former CEO of Focus Features was one of Weinstein’s main competitors. Two more documentaries about Weinstein are also being sold at Toronto: one by the Oscar-winning British producer Simon Chinn (Man on Wire, Searching for Sugar Man) and The Reckoning: Hollywood’s Worst Kept Secret from prolific director-producer Barry Avrich. Another high-profile project about Weinstein, based on the New York Times exposé by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, has been acquired by Brad Pitt and Megan Ellison.
