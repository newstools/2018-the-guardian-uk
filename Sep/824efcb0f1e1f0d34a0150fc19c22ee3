Stuart Broad broke a rib on the second morning of the fifth Test but it could not prevent him claiming the prized wicket of Virat Kohli first ball. The 32-year-old, whose removal of the Indian captain was one of the last interventions of a fourth day dripping in emotion from Alastair Cook’s 33rd and final Test century, has been bowling through the pain all match after being struck during England’s first innings. Jasprit Bumrah was the Indian seamer to inflict the blow, sending a rib-tickler into Broad’s side in the 100th over of the match, when he was on 10. He received some painkillers on the field and went on to make 38 in a ninth-wicket stand of 98 with Jos Buttler that saw England turn a perilous 214 for eight into 332 all out batting first. Going into the fifth day Broad had sent down 25 overs and picked up two wickets, the second of which ended Kohli’s stellar series of 593 runs when drawing an edge from the right-hander for the third golden duck of his Test career. Though the chances of Broad turning out for Nottinghamshire for the end of their County Championship campaign were always slim following five Tests in little more than six weeks, the injury means his season will end following the conclusion of the fifth day at the Oval. With a short healing time, there are currently no fears that Broad will be unfit for England’s next Test assignment – the three-match series against Sri Lanka that begins on 6 November – although it remains to be seen whether the selectors include him in the squad. Ed Smith, the national selector, is looking to tailor squads towards conditions and with Broad’s record in the subcontinent – 41 wickets at 36 apiece from 17 Tests – modest compared to an overall career of 433 wickets at 28 from 123, may consider resting him before a return for the Caribbean tour in January next year. England are set to lose 161 caps of experience through Cook’s impending retirement, however, and the management may wish to retain both of their remaining senior pros – Broad and his 36-year-old new ball partner Jimmy Anderson – even if the likelihood of requiring three spinners does not guarantee a place in the best XI.
