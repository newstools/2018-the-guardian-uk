No action will be taken against a Spanish player accused of racially abusing the England Under-17 international Morgan Gibbs-White during the World Cup final in India last year. The sport’s world governing body Fifa announced it had opened an investigation after Gibbs-White’s England team-mate Rhian Brewster told the Guardian he overheard the player call him a “monkey”. Fifa issued a statement on Thursday saying it had decided to dismiss all charges “in view of the lack of sufficient evidence that could corroborate the English player’s claim”. The Fifa statement added: “Despite the absence of a sanction, which can only be imposed on the basis of clear evidence, the disciplinary committee would like to restate Fifa’s unequivocal, zero‑tolerance stance against all forms of discrimination, as enshrined in the Fifa statutes.” Speaking to the Guardian in December 2017 about the Gibbs‑White incident, Brewster said: “Something happened in the box. As Morgan was running away, he [a Spain player] called him a monkey. It was a goal-kick and I was getting into position. “‘Morgan,’ I said, ‘did you hear that?’ He said: ‘Yeah, yeah, I thought I was the only one.’” Last month, European football’s governing body Uefa dismissed an allegation that Brewster was racially abused by the Spartak Moscow player Leonid Mironov during a Uefa Youth League tie in December 2017.
