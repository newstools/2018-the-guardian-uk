We met on the internet and have been together for 10 years now. It was love at first sight, and every day with him has been amazing. For a long time I wasn’t sure I’d ever find this kind of love – and now I have I know it’s life-changing. You learn a lot about yourself when you’re in a happy relationship, and I’ve learnt a lot about myself. Isaac has validated who I am as a person: he lets me be who I am. Other people will say, I’m not sure you’re right about that, or I’m not sure this is the right direction, but Isaac is always supportive. It’s teamwork because I validate him, too. As a couple we’re very stable, we enjoy simply being together, and our lives are hugely enhanced as a result. Some people say they don’t like growing older, but I feel it’s a beautiful thing now there are two of us growing old together. We both enjoy travel; we enjoy walking around, taking in the city. And there are different cultures in our relationship: Isaac is from Taiwan, and I’m from Holland. That makes things interesting for us. Is there someone you’d like to say thank you to?
