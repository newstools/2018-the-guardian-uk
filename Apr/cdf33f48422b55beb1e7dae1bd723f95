The elbow injury that forced transgender competitor Laurel Hubbard out of the Commonwealth Games weightlifting competition has ended her career. Having led the standings in the 90+kg division with a lift of 120kg in the snatch on Monday, she injured her arm after attempting 132kg with her third effort and was forced to withdraw. The 40-year-old, whose participation was criticised as “unfair” by the Samoan team, said at the time she thought she had ruptured a ligament in her left elbow. Hubbard said on Tuesday the injury was career-ending and she would not compete again. The 40-year-old, who lived as Gavin Hubbard until four years ago and competed at national level as a man, finished second in the women’s super-heavyweights behind American Sarah Robles at the world championships in December. Hubbard was expected to win gold on the Gold Coast, but her exit left the door open for Feagaiga Stowers to claim Samoa’s second weightlifting victory of the day, ahead of Charisma Amoe-Tarrant of Nauru and England’s Emily Campbell. The crowd had been supportive of Hubbard, who passed all requirements to make it into the Games and compete in the women’s competition. “The Australian crowd was magnificent,” she said. “It felt like just a big embrace. They really made me try to lift my best. I gave it everything and I regret I wasn’t able to make the lift today. “The Commonwealth Games here are a model for what sport can, and should, be. It’s an incredible environment and an amazing atmosphere. Without any doubt, they have lived up to the mantra of humanity, equality and decency.”
