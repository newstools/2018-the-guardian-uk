The Texas Republican Blake Farenthold resigned from Congress on Friday. Farenthold had announced in January that he would not seek re-election after allegations of sexual misconduct. In a statement released on Friday, he said: “While I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart it’s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve.” Farenthold faced scrutiny over his failure to reimburse taxpayers for an $84,000 settlement with a former staffer who alleged he told her about “wet dreams” and “sexual fantasies” he had about her. Those and other alleged sexual comments were detailed in a 2014 lawsuit. In a statement, Steve Stivers, head of the National Republican Campaign Committee, said: “I hope Blake is true to his word and pays back the $84,000 of taxpayer money he used as a settlement. As I have said repeatedly, Congress must hold ourselves to a higher standard and regain the trust of the American people.” Farenthold, who was first elected in 2010, is the latest member of Congress to leave over allegations of sexual misconduct. Senator Al Franken of Minnesota and the congressman Trent Franks of Arizona also resigned their positions. Others, including Rubén Kihuen of Nevada, have said they will retire in November. Farenthold has a long history of making controversial remarks. In 2016, he said in an interview he might still support Donald Trump if Trump endorsed rape. Last year, he said he might challenge female senators to duels – if not for their gender.
