All Black TJ Perenara has stated his “100%” opposition to comments on homosexuality made by the Australian rugby star Israel Folau in a series of tweets supporting “diverse” sexual orientations. The 42-Test New Zealand rugby star added his voice to a growing list of high-profile figures inside the game condemning Folau’s comments, including World Cup referee Nigel Owens, Super Rugby player Brad Weber, Wallaby Nic White and Welsh great Gareth Thomas. Having previously endorsed statements made by fellow New Zealander Weber, Perenara took to the social media platform Twitter to condemn comments that he believed “can’t be tolerated”.

Notably, young Māori and Pasifika people. “You don’t need to look far to know that young Māori/PI are overrepresented in youth suicide statistics and, as I understand it, even more so when you look to those who are part of the rainbow community. Comments that cause further harm cannot be tolerated. “Let it go on record that I am 100% against the comments that were made by Israel. It was not OK to say that. It’s not an attitude I want to see in the game I love. There is no justification for such harmful comments. “To anyone, young Māori/Pasifika people especially, who may be struggling with their identity – please know that it is OK to be you. You are perfect as you are. Do not let these comments keep you from being yourself. Polynesia has been sexually diverse since forever.” To anyone, young Māori/Pasifika people especially, who may be struggling with their identity - please know that it is ok to be you. You are perfect as you are. Do not let these comments keep you from being yourself. Polynesia has been sexually diverse since forever. Perenara echoed statements on Wednesday by one-cap All Black and Māori All Black Weber who had described the prospect of playing against Folau as disgusting. My cousin and her partner, and my Aunty and her partner are some of the most kind, caring & loving people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. To think that I play against someone that says they'll go to Hell for being gay disgusts me. 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 Both comments were praised by Australian rugby union player White, a former vice-captain of the Brumbies who is based in the UK with Exeter Chiefs. Hit the nail on the head @Tj_Perenara and @brad_weber9 hats off to you both for having the balls to speak up. For what it’s worth I completely agree and support you boys. “Know that it’s ok to be you” real class TJ #HalfbacksAreSmart 🌈 It follows a statement on Wednesday from experienced referee Owens who has officiated more than 150 international matches.The Welshman came out publicly in 2007 after attempting suicide at age 24, having struggled to come to terms with his sexuality. The now 46-year-old stresses that devout Christian Folau is entitled to his beliefs but says his comments would have been deeply hurtful during his difficult time.“For me it’s trying to get those people to understand, ‘Look, me being gay is not a choice,’ ” Owens told the Unfiltered podcast. “There are young people out there taking their own lives, feeling like I did.“And that’s what I wish people would think about and the way they convey their opinions and I wish they would try and understand that everybody’s different.“Judge me and other gay people, judge them on the content of their character, not their sexuality.” New Zealand Rugby also made a public statement on Wednesday restating its sworn commitment to “inclusion” and calling for “respectful” contributions. New Zealand Rugby is committed to Diversity and Inclusion, and welcomes people from all walks of life. We respect that people have different views and beliefs, however expect that any opinions and views are expressed in a respectful way. pic.twitter.com/tX8gkAwWcv Rugby Australia or the Qantas Wallabies have not made any public statements since Tuesday’s decision not to sanction Folau with the Wallaby restating his position two weeks after his initial Instagram comment in a column on Monday for the website Players’ Voice. “I don’t expect everyone to believe what I believe,” said Folau. “That goes for teammates, friends and even family members, some of whom are gay. “I don’t pretend to have all the answers in life. It can be difficult making the right decisions. “You are always trying to reconcile the truth from the Bible with things you feel inside. But I have faith that God’s path is the right one and that path is outlined in the Bible. I will keep sharing that.” Rugby Australia’s decision to not sanction Folau has left the president of the gay world rugby club champions, the Melbourne Chargers, “disappointed”. Xavier Goldie sent an open invitation for Folau to attend one of their training sessions in the hope he could understand why his comments were so hurtful to the gay community. “In the past, Rugby Australia has been a leader on standing up for diversity and inclusion in the sport, including gay people,” Goldie said.“We are disappointed they didn’t take action in response to Folau’s harmful comments.” • Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14.
