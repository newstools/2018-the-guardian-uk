Bryan Cranston (best actor, Network): “It’s very difficult to be mad as hell when you’re holding an Olivier award.” Jez Butterworth (best new play, The Ferryman): “I won one of these before, 22 years ago. After about 10 years, this bit on the bottom fell off ... I have to say I’m already worried. The build quality hasn’t improved.” Sheila Atim (best actress in a supporting role in a musical, Girl from the North Country): “I want to acknowledge some of the women who have been on this stage before me – last year, for example, Noma Dumezweni and Amber Riley, because they’ve been here accepting awards and they look a bit like me. And that to me is very, very important.” Catherine Tate (host): “When our next presenter was asked to fly over to play the part of Billy Flynn, this Academy Award winner said: ‘Show me the money!’ They did – but lucky for us he came anyway! Please welcome Cuba Gooding Jr.” Shirley Henderson (best actress in a musical, Girl from the North Country): “Oh yeah, Bob Dylan! I forgot about you! Thank you for letting us play around with your music.” Chita Rivera (presenter): “I’m excited that I’m here. Well, I’m excited that I’m anywhere!” Cameron Mackintosh (best new musical, Hamilton): “Andrew [Lloyd Webber] was the first person to tell me to get on a plane to go and see Hamilton. Thank you, Andrew, you were right as always.” James Graham (best comedy, Labour of Love): “To the Labour party for providing me with such good material – constantly and predictably.” Sam Mendes (best director, The Ferryman): “A relatively unsung hero of British theatre died this year, the director Howard Davies. I lost count of the number of times while I was directing this that I thought: How would Howard do this? This is dedicated to him.”
