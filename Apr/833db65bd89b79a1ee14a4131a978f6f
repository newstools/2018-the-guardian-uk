Two black men were left fearing for their lives after being arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks, as they were waiting for a business meeting. The arrests, recorded on a white customer’s cellphone video, have been widely seen across the country as an example of racism. The men, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, have met with the CEO of Starbucks and are pushing for meaningful change so what happened to them does not happen to anyone else. Police this week released a recording of the call from the Starbucks employee that led to the arrest. In it, a woman is heard saying the men refused to “make a purchase or leave”. Starbucks has promised to shut all 8,000 company-owned stores across the US on 29 May to train employees about unconscious bias. Robinson said he appreciates the public support the men have received but anger and boycotting Starbucks are not the solution. “We need a different type of action … not words,” he said. “It’s a time to pay attention and understand what’s really going on.
