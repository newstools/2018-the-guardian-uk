Kanye West has announced two new albums both launching in June. After returning to Twitter from an 11-month absence, the Grammy award-winning rapper tweeted that the first album will be released on 1 June and will feature just seven songs. The second will be a collaborative effort with Kid Cudi and will launch on 8 June. The pair, who have worked together on multiple occasions before, will be known collectively as Kids See Ghost. He has also tweeted two more dates along with other names: Pusha T on 25 May and Teyana Taylor on 22 June. Both stars are part of West’s record label Good Music. The reveal arrives after the rapper has been live-tweeting a philosophy book that is set to be called Break the Simulation. “I’ve got a concept about photographs, and I’m on the fence about photographs – about human beings being obsessed with photographs – because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future,” West said in an interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt on the Hollywood Reporter. West’s last album The Life of Pablo was released in 2016, featuring guest appearances from Rihanna, Chris Brown and Frank Ocean. Even after the official release, he continued to make changes, calling it “a living, breathing, changing, creative expression”. It became his seventh consecutive number one album in the US yet missed out on the best rap album Grammy to Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book. Cudi most recently contributed to the soundtrack for Dwayne Johnson adventure Rampage. In March, West was reportedly seen at a studio in Wyoming with rumored guests including Drake, The Dream, Travis Scott and Kid Cudi.
