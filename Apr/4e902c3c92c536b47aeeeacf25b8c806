A Syrian rebel group has accused government forces of dropping a barrel bomb containing poisonous chemicals on civilians in eastern Ghouta and a medical relief organisation said 35 people had been killed in chemical attacks on the area. Syrian state media denied claims by Jaish al-Islam that government forces had launched any chemical attack and said rebels in the eastern Ghouta town of Douma were in a state of collapse and spreading false news. Medical relief organisation Syrian American Medical Society (Sams) said a chlorine bomb hit a Douma hospital, killing six people, and a second attack with “mixed agents” including nerve agents had hit a nearby building. The US state department said on Saturday that reports of mass casualties were “horrifying” and would demand an international response if confirmed. Citing a history of chemical weapons use by the government of Bashar al-Assad, state department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the regime and its backer Russia needed to be held accountable and “any further attacks prevented immediately”. “Russia, with its unwavering support for the regime ultimately bears responsibility for these brutal attacks,” Nauert said. Basel Termanini, the US-based vice-president of Sams, said the total death toll in the chemical attacks was 35. “We are contacting the UN and the US government and the European governments,” he said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 11 people had died in Douma as a result of suffocation caused by the smoke from conventional weapons being dropped by the government. It said 70 people suffered breathing difficulties. Rami Abdulrahman, the Observatory director, said he could not confirm if chemical weapons had been used. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Syrian state news agency Sana said Jaish al-Islam, making “chemical attack fabrications in an exposed and failed attempt to obstruct advances by the Syrian Arab army”, citing an official source.
