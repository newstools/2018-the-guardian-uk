I’d trust Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson with my life. His face? Trustworthy. His voice? Reassuring. His ability to fly a helicopter, to calmly parachute from a burning plane, to concuss (but not kill) enemies, and to communicate with primates? All are more than competently demonstrated in Rampage, a big-budget action movie about the Rock’s race to stop three giant, mutant animals running riot on the streets of Chicago. Davis Okoye (Johnson, whose liquid charisma is the film’s life force) is a primatologist who buddies up with rebel scientist Dr Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) when his beloved albino gorilla, George, becomes infected with a banned genetic editing agent. The pace slackens over the course of the protracted finale, a set piece that uses ugly, video game-style CGI (and a palette of sickly, ashy greys) to depict a battle for the city. These action sequences aren’t anywhere near as much fun as the ensemble cast, which includes Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s FBI agent (pastiche-y southern drawl and suit included) and romcom nice boy Jake Lacy (Obvious Child, Girls) as a sweaty, slightly useless Pop-Tart-eating minion to his evil genius sister.
