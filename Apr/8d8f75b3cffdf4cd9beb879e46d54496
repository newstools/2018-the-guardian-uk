New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is calling for reform of the criminal justice system after visiting rapper Meek Mill in a Pennsylvania prison. Kraft and Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin visited the Philadelphia-born rapper on Tuesday. “He’s an amazing young man,” Kraft said outside the State Correctional Institution-Chester. “I know how I’d feel if I were in the situation he is. He’s very intelligent. “I’ve had the pleasure, through Michael, [of] getting to know him over the last two to three years – maybe even longer. Every time I see him, I just come away more impressed. It makes it clear to me we have to do something with criminal justice reform.” He added: “It’s really bad. I know some of our players in the NFL have talked about this. I see it firsthand. It’s just wrong. We have to find a way to correct it and also help the community help themselves. It’s just sad. This guy is a great guy. Shouldn’t be here. And then think of all the taxpayers here paying for people like this to be in jail and not out being productive.” Rubin said he believes “the right thing will happen” and Mill will be released soon. Mill, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, is fighting for release while appealing a two- to four-year sentence for a probation violation. A judge said his drug use, arrests and other issues while under supervision merited the jail time. Mill’s lawyers have accused her of turning the case into a “personal vendetta.”
