Something unusual happened in the Balearic Islands earlier this season. For the first time in 37 years, Real Mallorca met local rivals Atlético Baleares in the league. Anyone with a passing interest in Spanish football over the last 20 years will be familiar with Real Mallorca. They finished fifth in La Liga as recently as 2010 and have graced European and Spanish finals. They faces Sven-Göran Eriksson’s Lazio in the Cup-Winners’ Cup final at Villa Park in 1999; they beat Arsenal in their first ever Champions League game in 2001; and in 2003 their all-time top scorer, Samuel Eto’o, scored twice as they won the Copa del Rey, the best moment in the club’s history. Although they have fallen on harder times recently, Real Mallorca have tasted glory well beyond the dreams of Atlético Baleares. While their local rivals were breaking into the top three in La Liga, Los Balearicos dropped as low as the fifth tier. They were kicked out of their ground, nearly went out of business and became accustomed to playing Real Mallorca’s B team. But things have changed. Atlético Baleares have survived, a victory in itself, and are doing the previously unthinkable – competing with their island rivals. Twenty year after their victory over Real Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, Real Mallorca now find themselves in the third tier – with their old rivals. This derby boils down to one question: who is Palma’s real team? Real Mallorca fans say their club has put the island on the map, while Atlético Baleares supporters believe sticking by a club means more than pursuing glory. Either way, their antipathy never disappeared. Mallorca fans kept singing about their island neighbours in their glory years and Atlético Baleares supporters never faltered in their desire to bring down their city rivals. With Real looking set for promotion and Atlético battling against relegation, it could well be another 37 years before these two sides meet again. This was a match we simply couldn’t afford to miss.
