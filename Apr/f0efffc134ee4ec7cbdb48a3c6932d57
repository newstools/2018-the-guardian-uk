The Screen Actors Guild has called for an end to private meetings in “high-risk locations” in the wake of a string of sexual assault allegations in Hollywood. Sag-Aftra, the labor union for actors in film and television, has issued a guideline calling on producers and executives to avoid arranging meetings in hotel rooms or private residences. The document notes that “misconduct … often occurs outside of the formal workplace setting”. “We are committed to addressing the scenario that has allowed predators to exploit performers behind closed doors under the guise of a professional meeting,” said Gabrielle Carteris, Sag-Aftra president. In the unlikely event that the meeting cannot take place in a more open setting, the document suggests that a “support peer” be present. It is part of a new initiative by the union to confront and help eradicate harassment and assault in the industry. In February, a detailed code of conduct was also released. “All professionals, including Sag-Aftra members, are expected to refrain from engaging in harassing conduct and support efforts to eliminate this scourge from the workplace,” the union said. The move has been welcomed by the Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, a group assembled by the Writers Guild of America. “The commission applauds Sag-Aftra’s recently issued guideline number one,” said Anita Hill, who spearheads the group, in a statement. “The implementation of this guideline marks an important first step in communicating appropriate industry standards for professional practices.” The move follows on from a string of accusations against a number of major industry players, including Harvey Weinstein who has been accused of assaulting women in hotel rooms. Since the allegations originally surfaced last October, the union has been receiving an avaerage of five reports of sexual misconduct a day.
