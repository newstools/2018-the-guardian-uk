Don’t let sadness force you to buy into the idea that you’ve done anything wrong, or that there’s something fundamentally wrong with you. It’s hard enough to cope with without beating yourself up more. Seek out other people who know what you’re going through. It can take a long time to give up hope of becoming a biological parent, but with that can come real grief, which is often unrecognised by others. Look for involuntarily childless people online or via local groups. It’s a huge help having others who understand how it feels to be “the last one standing” among your mates. Ignore anyone who tells you to relax and it will magically happen. Parenthood is not the only way to have a fulfilling and meaningful life. Putting all your focus on becoming a parent can make you lose sight of the other great aspects of your life, so make a point of enjoying those things, especially the ones that are easier for people without the responsibilities of parenthood. Don’t fall prey to grief tourism, which can come from strangers as well as those close to you. Some people are simply too nosy, demanding details in the guise of caring. When pressed too far on the children issue, say, “I just can’t talk about it”, and hope they feel embarrassed enough to back off. The relationships you have with godchildren, nieces and nephews, and friends’ children can be very special and even healing. You may be childless in the sense of not giving birth, but that doesn’t stop a multitude of small people loving you because they want to and enjoying having fun with you.
