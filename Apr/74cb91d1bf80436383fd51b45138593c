Make a spice mix in a food processor blender by grinding the following ingredients to a paste: 2 cloves of garlic, a 20g piece of ginger, peeled, 2 tsp each of ground turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander, ground cumin and the black seeds from 6 green cardamom pods. Add 1 tsp of ground chilli and 3 tbsp of groundnut or vegetable oil. Cook the paste over a low heat for 4 or 5 minutes, then stir in 250ml of double cream and a little salt. Set aside. Cut an aubergine into 3cm cubes, then fry in 4 tbsp of oil until soft and golden. Tear 200g of paneer into rough pieces and add to the aubergine, with 100g of cashew nuts, letting the nuts and paneer colour lightly. Combine the aubergines, paneer and cashews with the warm spiced cream. Get the mixture hot, then remove from the heat and stir in 150ml of yogurt and a handful of coriander leaves. Serve with warm flatbread. Enough for 2-3 with rice or bread. I sometimes add a pinch of sugar to the spice pâté which has the effect of softening the spices and producing a more mellow flavour. Rather than aubergine, I sometimes like to use brown chestnut mushrooms instead, slicing them thickly and frying for a few minutes in the oil before adding the paneer.
