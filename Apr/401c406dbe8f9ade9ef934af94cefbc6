TalkSport has announced a major coup late Tuesday after outbidding the BBC to secure the free-to-air radio broadcast rights for England’s forthcoming tours of Sri Lanka and the West Indies. It ends a 13-year association for the BBC, who last lost the rights to an oversees national team cricket tour in 2005, also on that occasion to TalkSport. Scott Taunton, chief exe of Wireless Group Limited, the parent company for TalkSport, was bullish in announcing the changes, as he spoke to Radio Today. “Winning these prestigious rights is a great victory for TalkSport and its first-class coverage. England’s overseas tours are sure to lure large audiences of fans as we cement TalkSport’s position as the fans’ favourite for sporting news, analysis and live coverage. “I’m delighted that we will be with England fans for every ball of the day throughout these winter tours, with our own expert line-up of cricketing stars.” I think the response to this tweet speaks volumes. I know our loyal @bbctms listeners will be very disappointed and I’m very sorry. I hope I can still provide news coverage on BBC. To be clear, it has nothing to do with @ECB_cricket. SL and WI Board decision https://t.co/dMFh8fmbxL The rights cover all the Test matches, ODIs and T20 internationals from each tour with the first England game to be broadcast an ODI against Sri Lanka on October 10, 2018. It is understood TalkSport is also currently in negotiations to secure the rights for the 2019-20 tour to South Africa.
