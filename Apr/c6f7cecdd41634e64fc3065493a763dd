A Hobart DJ who headbutted the former prime minister Tony Abbott will spend at least two months behind bars. Astro Labe, 38, pleaded guilty in January to causing harm to a commonwealth public official over the headline-drawing attack in September. On Monday he was sentenced in Hobart magistrates court to a six-month jail term, though he will be eligible for release after two months. During the trial, the court heard that Labe had followed Abbott for about 250 metres and offered to shake his hand before “launching” into a headbutt on 21 September. Abbott said he had been left shocked and with a fat lip. The Hobart DJ was arrested the next day and told police in an interview there was no one reason for his actions. “I just hate Tony Abbott,” the court heard he told police. “I can’t specify anything.” Labe’s initial charge of common assault was upgraded to a federal offence that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. His lawyer, Craig Mackie, said Labe, who moved to Tasmania 22 years ago, was not a person of violent disposition and had “never headbutted anyone before”. “This can only be categorised as being at the very lowest end of the scale,” Mackie said in court.
