This is a chocolate tart like none you’ve ever had before. The caramel in the ganache filling makes every bite a glorious, gooey celebration of chocolate. And, in one of those happy but rare coincidences, the taste is matched by its simplicity: just 20 minutes of preparation. The hardest thing is having to wait for it to chill before you can eat it. There’s no need to buy premium chocolate for this recipe. I used a mixture of own-brand supermarket stuff and it worked out just fine; perhaps even better. Prep 20 minCook 20 minCool 2 hr For the biscuit base150g Hobnob biscuits45g cocoa powder45g light brown sugar¼ tsp table salt80g salted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing For the filling1 x 400g can condensed milk caramel250g milk chocolate125g dark chocolate150g double cream2 pinches flaky sea salt Start with the biscuit base: put the Hobnobs into a plastic bag and bash them into crumbs with a rolling pin (or if you’re feeling less destructive, give them a quick blitz in a food processor). Stir in the cocoa, sugar and salt, followed by the butter. Line the base of a 25cm round tart tin with greaseproof paper, grease the sides with some extra butter, then firmly press the crumb mixture into the tin, taking extra care with the sides and aiming for an equal thickness throughout. Pop it into the freezer to chill for 10 minutes, then bake at 200C/390F/gas 6 for 10-12 minutes. Take out of the oven and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, make the chocolate fudge filling. Put all the ingredients (apart from the salt) into a saucepan and gently warm over a low-medium heat. Keep stirring the mixture until the chocolate has melted and the ganache is smooth and glossy. Pour into the cooled biscuit base and chill in the fridge for a couple of hours. Sprinkle the sea salt over just before serving.
