Gloria Allred, the lawyer who represented many of Bill Cosby accusers, said the guilty verdict against the comedian was a vindication. “We are so happy that finally we can say, women are believed, and not only in a hashtag #MeToo, but also in a court of law,” she said. Other supporters of the #MeToo campaign have also welcomed Cosby’s conviction. Cosby was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former basketball player who was 30 years old at the time. Cosby claimed the two had a consensual relationship. Five women in addition to Constand testified for the prosecution at the trial that Cosby had assaulted them. Cosby did not testify in his own defense. The five women joined a news conference outside the courthouse with Allred. “After all is said and done, women were finally believed, and we thank the jury for that,” Allred said. The actor Rose McGowan, who has made rape allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, said on Twitter: “Cosby is guilty. I’m sorry if you loved a lie. His victims can now exhale. Thank you judge and jury. Thank you society for waking up.” Mira Sorvino, another Weinstein accuser, said it was “unbelievably amazing news” that Cosby had been convicted. Tarana Burke, cofounder of the #MeToo movement, said the verdict against Cosby made her cry. Actor Jessica Chastain tweeted: “Just because you’re rich and powerful doesn’t mean another person’s body is automatically available for sex. Consent must be given.” Susan Sarandon said: “With Bill Cosby’s guilty verdict I hope these women find some peace and that all those who have not been able to find justice in other instances with other men have hope that they too will be heard.” Filmmaker Seth MacFarlane said: “The Cosby conviction is a resonant reminder that power and influence come with significant responsibility, and must never, ever be abused in an evolved society. Hopefully this is only the first step forward.”
