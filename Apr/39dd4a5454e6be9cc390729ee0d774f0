Tom Brady’s agent put to rest any speculation his client was considering walking away from football, confirming to ESPN’s Adam Schefter on Monday that he expects the New England Patriots quarterback to return for the 2018 season. “Tom’s intentions have not changed,” Yee said. “He’s consistently said he’ll play beyond this contract and into his mid-40s, or until he feels he isn’t playing at a championship level. I understand the constant speculation, but this is one point he’s been firm about.” Brady, who will be 41 when the Patriots open their season in September, had said he would return for 2018 ahead of New England’s loss in Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles, but Schefter reported last week the quarterback had yet to commit to a return, citing sources who said there are people around him who would rather see him retire. Yee added: “He customizes his preparation to each season in order to maximize his performance. ... His training methods are always evolving and getting better. The year he missed the first four games -- that month of training on his own was particularly efficient.” Brady threw for an NFL-best 4,577 yards and 286.1 passing yards per game in 2017.
