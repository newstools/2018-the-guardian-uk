Mauricio Pochettino has responded to revelations over the salary of Tottenham’s chairman, Daniel Levy, by saying it is good news for the club. Tottenham’s accounts were published this week and showed Levy had earned £6.013m in the year 2016-17, more than any player there. That figure included a backdated pay rise as well as bonuses and came on the back of record revenue for the club. Although reports have suggested players have been shocked at Levy’s earnings, Pochettino was sanguine about the news before Saturday’s Premier League encounter at Stoke. “I think it’s very good news for the club,” he said. “It was a record for the club and was very positive news for Tottenham. From then it’s not my point to talk; I don’t know the reality [of Levy’s pay]. He is my boss and I need to respect everything my boss does.” Asked whether the revelation made him think about his own contract, Pochettino said: “We are always in contact with [Levy] but I still have three years on my contract. I have three years more after this season. Today we are so focused on trying to achieve what we want on the pitch. It is up to him or the club to have contact with me if they are happy with my job to offer or not. But personally I am happy.” Spurs travel to Stoke after last week’s cathartic victory over Chelsea with Pochettino insisting the encounter with the Premier League relegation strugglers is a more important fixture. “Last week was fantastic in the moment but sometimes after a great victory you can drop a little in focus. For me it’s the opposite; now our focus must be at 200%. It will be a tougher game against Stoke. Three points will be massive for them and for us too. “In the last few games Stoke have had very consistent performances. Arsenal won [3-0] in the end last week but in the first half Stoke played so well. We are aware how they will play, we need to match them with determination and aggression.”
