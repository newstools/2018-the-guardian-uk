Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to testify before a joint hearing of two Senate committees, in addition to his appearance before a House committee next week. The Facebook CEO will appear before the Senate judiciary and commerce committees on Tuesday, and then the House energy and commerce committee on Wednesday. The hearings come as authorities around the world investigate allegations that the political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately accessed data on as many as 87 million Facebook users to influence elections. This will be Zuckerberg’s first ever testimony before Congress. In Britain, Zuckerberg has refused to testify before the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, a decision its chair Damian Collins called “absolutely astonishing”. Facebook has suggested one of two executives could speak to parliament instead.
