These are all the transfers/seasons that post-date May 2009 when Ellis Short assumed full control of Sunderland. Short did take a controlling interest in the club in September 2008 but we have not included recruitment between then and summer 2009 as, at that time, he delegated transfer business to Niall Quinn and the Drumaville consortium also still had a limited say. Manager: Steve Bruce Players • Fraizer Campbell (Manchester United, £3.5m): Pacey striker’s progress was interrupted by knee problems. 6/10 • Paulo da Silva (Deportivo Toluca, free): Paraguay centre-half struggled to adapt to English football and culture. 5/10 • Lorik Cana (Marseille, £5m): Tough-tackling Albania midfielder swiftly became a Wearside cult hero. Hearts were broken when Cana left for Galatasaray after only one season. 8/10 • Darren Bent (Tottenham, £10m): His goals made him a north-east hero. Little has gone right for both Sunderland and Bent since they parted. 9/10 • Lee Cattermole (Wigan, £6m): The combative midfielder polarises opinion. A powerful dressing-room influence, Cattermole can be constructive and destructive in equal measure. 7/10 • John Mensah (Lyon, loan): The rock was an outstanding defender, sadly eroded by injuries. 6/10 • Michael Turner (Hull, £4m): Did OK at centre-half for a while. 6/10 • Bolo Zenden (Marseille, free):  Past his best but still a cut above most team-mates and often a joy to watch. Excellent dressing-room influence. 8/10 Manager: Steve Bruce Players • Ahmed Elmohamady (Enppi, loan leading to £2m): Popular Egypt right-back or right winger who did well. 7/10 • Simon Mignolet (Sint-Truiden, £2m): The Belgian has his critics at Liverpool but shone on Wearside. An inspired signing. 9/10 • Titus Bramble (Wigan, £1m): Bruce revealed that his late father asked “why?” when he bought the defender, cautioning: “Bramble can play but he’s always got a mistake in him.” 5/10 • Cristian Riveros (Cruz Azul, free): The Paraguayan midfielder swiftly fell out of favour. 5/10 • Marcos Angeleri (Estudiantes, £1.5m): A centre-half derailed by knee trouble. 3/10 • Danny Welbeck (Manchester United, loan): Impressed. A star in the making. 8/10 • Nedum Onuoha (Manchester City, loan): Generally decent at right-back. 7/10 • Asamoah Gyan (Rennes, £13m): Flamboyant record attacking signing scored 10 goals in 34 appearances before departing for Al-Ain in the UAE. 6/10 • Sulley Muntari (Internazionale, loan): Midfielder swiftly passed through. 6/10 • Stéphane Sessègnon (Paris Saint-Germain, £6m): Gifted, if consistent, winger proved crowd favourite. 7/10 Managers: Steve Bruce and Martin O’Neill Players • Conor Wickham (Ipswich, £12m): Hit the odd height but never quite fulfilled his rich teenage promise on Wearside. 6/10 • Nicklas Bendtner (Arsenal, loan): What a wasted talent. Way too self-obsessed. Had comedic value though. 7/10 • Wes Brown (Manchester United, £1m): Showed flashes of defender he once was – but with very bad knees. 6/10 • John O’Shea (Manchester United, £5m): Would star in some epic relegation struggles. Still part of Coleman’s defence. 7/10 • James McClean (Derry City, £350,000): Raw, sometimes menacing, winger, now at West Brom. 7/10 • Keiren Westwood (Coventry, free): OK in goal. 6/10 • Seb Larsson (Birmingham, free): Midfielder had some good games and took some decent dead-balls. 7/10 • Ji Dong-won (Chunnam Dragons, £2m): A failed attacking experiment. 5/10 • Craig Gardner (Birmingham, £6m): Steady utility player with an eye for long-range goals. 6/10 • David Vaughan (Blackpool, free): Nice passer but a bit lightweight. 6/10 • Wayne Bridge (Manchester City, loan): The left-back was not at his best. 4/10 • Sotirios Kyrgiakos (Wolfsburg, loan): Defender made three appearances. 4/10 Managers: Martin O’Neill and Paolo Di Canio Players • Carlos Cuéllar (Aston Villa, free): Did a limited job. 5/10 • Louis Saha (Tottenham, free): Well past his best. 5/10 • Steven Fletcher (Wolves, £12m): Scored a few goals. 7/10 • Adam Johnson (Manchester City, £12m): The former England winger is now in prison. Consistently underachieved on pitch. 4/10 • Danny Rose (Tottenham, loan): The left-back’s potential was clear. 8/10 • James McFadden (Everton, free): Why? 4/10 • Alfred N’Diaye (Bursaspor, £3.8m): Midfielder hinted at better things to come. They never did. 5/10 • Kadar Mangane (Al-Hilal, loan): Long forgotten. 4/10 • Danny Graham (Swansea, £5m): Not a Premier League striker. 5/10 Managers: Paolo Di Canio and Gus Poyet Players • Duncan Watmore (Altrincham, £1m): Smart signing. Watmore is a pacey, industrious forward who has been much missed since suffering a serious knee injury. 8/10 • Modibo Diakité (Lazio, free): The defender had decent pedigree but was never fit. 5/10 • David Moberg Karlsson (Gothenburg, £1.5m): The forward never made the first team. 2/10 • Cabral (Basel, free): The lesser-spotted midfielder’s most notable act was to be charged with rape. Emblematic of Roberto De Fanti’s perplexing recruitment policy during his time as director of football. 2/10 • Valentin Roberge (Maritimo, free): OK but failed to pull up any trees at centre-half. 5/10 • Vito Mannone (Arsenal £2m): Did a decent job during his time in the north-east. 7/10 • Jozy Altidore (AZ Alkmaar, £6m): The USA forward struggled painfully. 4/10 • El Hadji-Ba (Le Havre, £3m): Who? Midfielder made one appearance. 3/10 • Emmanuele Giaccherini (Juventus, £8.5m): Gifted, potentially influential Italy midfielder, misused by Sunderland. Poyet initially thought he was too lightweight and, when he finally changed his mind, Giaccherini got injured. 7/10 • Ondrej Celustka (Trabzonspoor, loan): Barely remembered Czech defender. 5/10 • Charis Mavrias (Panathinkaikos, £3m): The Greek winger had ability, shame it was rarely utilised properly. 6/10 • Ki (Swansea, loan): Lovely passer. Classy but a tendency to hide when the going gets tough. 7/10 • Fabio Borini (Liverpool, loan which eventually became £10m transfer): Egotistical forward had his moments. Currently on loan at Milan.Mark: 7/10 • Andrea Dossena (Napoli, free): Barely remembered defender.Mark: 5/10 • Marcos Alonso (Fiorentina loan): Classy left-back, has since fulfilled his clear potential at Chelsea. 8/10 • Santiago Vergini (Estudiantes, loan, leading to £2m signing): Better at right-back than centre-half but another poor buy. 4/10 • Oscar Ustari (Almeira, free): Brief stint as back-up goalkeeper. 5/10 • Ignacio Scocco (Internacional free): Striker failed to adapt to English football. 2/10 • Liam Bridcutt (Brighton, £4m): A Poyet favourite, the defensive midfielder soon disappointed. 5/10 Manaagers: Gus Poyet and Dick Advocaat Players • Billy Jones (West Brom, free): Limited right back with excellent attitude. 6/10 • Jordi Gómez (Wigan, free): Midfielder could not quite make skill count. 6/10 • Costel Pantilimon (Manchester City, free): Decent cover keeper but disruptive dressing-room presence. 5/10 • Jack Rodwell (Manchester City, £10m): One of the most disastrous signings of the Short era. The midfielder cannot make Coleman’s team but has declined Sunderland’s offer to settle his contract. 2/10 • Patrick van Aanholt (Chelsea, £1.5m): The pacey left-back divided opinion but became one of the few recent Sunderland players to have been sold on for a profit when joined Crystal Palace for £4m. 7/10 • Will Buckley (Brighton £2.5m): Never going to be a Premier League winger. 5/10 • Anthony Réveillère (Napoli, free): Did a job at full-back. 6/10 • Jermain Defoe (Toronto, £6m): Star buy. Brilliant Poyet signing, the former England striker kept Sunderland in the Premier League longer than they arguably deserved. The former director of football Lee Congerton deserves credit for pulling off the deal. 10/10 • Sebastian Coates (Liverpool, loan which became £2m transfer): Recruited by Poyet, the Uruguayan was subsequently moved on by Sam Allardyce. 4/10 • Ricky Álvarez (Internazionale, loan that became £10m transfer): What a disaster. A knee injury wrecked Álvarez’s Wearside career but, following a legal dispute, Sunderland ended up forking out around £10m for him. 4/10 Managers: Dick Advocaat and Sam Allardyce • Jeremain Lens (£10m Dynamo Kiev): Talented Dutch winger failed to apply himself. Now at Besiktas. 5/10 • Yann M’Vila (Rubin Kazan, loan): A very big hit. Former France central midfielder seriously raised the tone. David Moyes’s biggest mistake was not signing M’Vila for £7m in summer 2016. A class act. 9/10 • Younès Kaboul (Tottenham, £3m): Under-achieved under Advocaat, impressed hugely under Allardyce but family failed to settle on Wearside and swiftly decamped to Watford. 8/10 • Ola Toivonen (Rennes, loan): Limited Swedish forward. 4/10 • Adam Matthews (Celtic £2m): Not good enough at right-back. 4/10 • DeAndre Yedlin (Spurs loan): Pacey right-back did well. Now a regular at Newcastle United. 7/10 • Wahbi Khazri (Bordeaux £9m): Tunisia winger excelled as inspired Allardyce buy. Fell out with Moyes, now on loan at Rennes. 7/10 • Lamine Koné (Lorient £5m): Shone in defence under Allardyce, has underachieved horribly since Moyes rejected £18m bid for him from Everton. 6/10 • Jan Kirchhoff (Bayern Munich £750,000): Intelligent defensive midfielder who impressed under Allardyce but released after his ability was undermined by persistent injuries. 8/10 • Steve Harper (unattached): Cover goalkeeper. 6/10 • Emmanuel Eboué (free agent): Disaster. Former Arsenal full-back exited after being banned from playing by Fifa. 2/10 • Dame N’Doye (Trabzonspor, loan): Attacking Allardyce gamble which failed to pay off. 5/10 Manager: David Moyes Players • Didier N’dong (Lorient £13.6m): The Gabon midfielder, Sunderland’s overpriced record signing, is now on loan at Watford. 6/10 • Papy Djilobodji (Chelsea, £8m): A disastrous buy at centre-half. Now on loan at Dijon. 3/10 • Adnan Januzaj (Manchester United, loan): Gifted but failed to make his presence count. A major disappointment. 5/10 • Paddy McNair (Manchester United, £5m): A decent utility player whose progress has been interrupted by a severe knee injury. 7/10 • Donald Love (Manchester United, £1m): Tries but not good enough at right-back. 6/10 • Steven Pienaar (Everton, free): The years had caught up with the South African. 5/10 • Jason Denayer (Manchester City, loan): Had some decent games at centre-half. 7/10 • Javier Manquillo (Atlético Madrid, loan): Struggled horribly. Now a squad player at Newcastle United slowly improving under Rafael Benítez’s tutelage. 5/10 • Victor Anichebe (free agent): Showed flashes of the player he once threatened to become. 6/10 • Mika (Boavista, free): Not good enough for cup games, never played and now at Uniao de Leiria. 2/10 • Darron Gibson (Everton £2.5m): Recently sacked after drink-driving charge. Major midfield disappointment. 2/10 • Bryan Oviedo (Everton £2m): OK-ish at left-back. 5/10 • Joleon Lescott (free agent): Way off the pace. 2/10 Managers: Simon Grayson and Chris Coleman Players • James Vaughan (Bury, £500,000): Ineffective striker was offloaded to Wigan in January. 2/10 • Jason Steele (Blackburn £500,000): Error-prone keeper soon lost his place. 4/10 • Aiden McGeady (Everton £250,000): Talented winger but there’s a reason why he was so cheap. 5/10 • Marc Wilson (Bournemouth, free): Defender past his best. 4/10 • Robbin Ruiter (Utrecht, free): Keeper was improving, slightly, until he suffered a severe finger injury. 5/10 • Callum McManaman (West Brom, free): Has ability but inconsistent. 4/10 • Tyias Browning (Everton, loan): Not the best defender. 3/10 • Lewis Grabban (Bournemouth, loan): A hit! The striker scored 12 goals in 20 games before decamping to Aston Villa in January. 9/10 • Jonny Williams (Crystal Palace, loan): Gifted attacking midfielder is horribly injury-prone. 6/10 • Brendan Galloway (Everton, loan): Left-back has struggled. 4/10 • Lee Camp (Cardiff, loan): January signing by Coleman signing has proved a calamity in goal. 4/10 • Kazenga Lua Lua (Brighton, free): Minimal impact. 3/10 • Jake Clarke-Salter (Chelsea, loan): Young centre-back is way out of his depth. 3/10 • Ovie Ejaria (Liverpool, loan): Too much too soon for young midfielder. 4/10 • Ashley Fletcher (Middlesbrough, loan): There’s a reason why Tony Pulis farmed the ineffective striker out. 4/10
