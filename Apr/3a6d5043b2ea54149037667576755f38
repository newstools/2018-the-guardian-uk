Captain Ash Hewson has landed an after-the-siren extra-time penalty goal to give NSW a dramatic 16-13 win in the inaugural Super W women’s rugby final at Allianz Stadium. Fullback Hewson pulled off a sensational try-saving tackle on Queensland counterpart Samantha Treherne just before full-time on Friday evening with the scores locked at 13-13. She then landed a close-range penalty at the end of the extra-time period of five-minute halves. Queensland five-eighth Zahara Te Mara had kicked a penalty goal at the end of regulation time to force the game into extra time. NSW dominated the first half of extra-time, but Queensland’s defence held firm as they withstood several pick-and-go runs close to their line. NSW completed an unbeaten five-match campaign, but Queensland scored two tries to one and forced the home team to dig deep. Both of the visitors’ five-pointers came from 60-metre runs after pouncing on a NSW error. It was a fiercely contested game befitting a final and featured some massive defensive plays. Hewson posted the first points of the match with a close-range penalty in the 12th minute. Flanker Lavinia Gould pulled off a 60-metre intercept try to give the visitors a 5-3 lead. Hewson booted a second penalty, but missed a third on the stoke of half-time, which came with the home team holding a 6-5 lead. Centre Naraeta Marsters grabbed the lead back for Queensland when NSW lost the ball and she fended off Hewson in an unstoppable charge to the line. Gould was sin-binned for offside in the 63rd minute and, within three minutes, NSW replacement prop Melissa Fatu crashed over. Hewson converted to give NSW a 13-10 advantage.
