Pep Guardiola has been hit with two separate Uefa disciplinary charges as a result of the Manchester City manager’s dismissal in the Champions League defeat by Liverpool. Guardiola was sent to the stands by the referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz at the end of the first half after coming on to the pitch at half-time to protest over a disallowed effort by Leroy Sané. The Spanish official ruled out the tap-in for offside, though there was considerable sympathy for the City manager given the ball came to Sané after Loris Karius’s punch rebounded off James Milner. Having been ordered away from the dugout and technical area Guardiola was then subject to a Uefa regulation that forbids any communication with coaching staff on the sidelines, but it is understood the governing body believes he may have contravened this rule and will charge him with improper conduct. Guardiola has admitted telling the referee the goal should have stood, though he denies using bad language. The flashpoint came at a crucial stage of the match, with City leading 1-0. Had Sané’s effort counted they would have gone in 2-0 ahead, with every chance of going on to cancel out Liverpool’s 3-0 lead from the first leg. In the event their momentum stalled in the second half and Liverpool scored twice to run out 5-1 aggregate winners. Liverpool have been charged with disciplinary offences over the behaviour of their fans. Uefa alleges fireworks were let off and objects thrown at the Etihad, just as they were outside Anfield when the City team bus was attacked before last week’s game. Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body next convenes at the end of next month.
