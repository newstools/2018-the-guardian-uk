Donald Trump has signed an executive order establishing a task force to study the finances of the United States Postal System. The order does not specifically mention online shopping giant Amazon but Trump has complained that the company’s deal with the USPS is a money loser for the service. Trump has become railing against the company and its owner, Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, in recent weeks. The task force will be assigned to study such factors as pricing in the package delivery market. It will have 120 days to submit a report with its recommendations. Trump says in the order that the USPS is on “an unsustainable financial path” and “must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout”. Trump has tweeted wrongly that “Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon” and has promised, “this will be changed”.
