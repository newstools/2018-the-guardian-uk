Animal cruelty investigators are appealing for information after a cat survived a 100ft fall having reportedly being thrown from a block of flats. The RSPCA said the animal suffered a broken jaw in the incident in Guild Close, Birmingham, on 6 April, and was lucky to be alive. The young white cat was taken to RSPCA Newbrook Farm animal hospital after CCTV controllers became concerned she may have been thrown from the building. The charity is trying to track down the owners to determine how she managed to fall from such a height. Inspector Mike Scargill said: “This is a very worrying incident and the cat is extremely lucky to be alive. I am appealing to the general public for any information that might help me investigate what happened. “The cat may have slipped and fallen on her own, but it’s very concerning to hear that the CCTV controllers think they may have seen someone actually throw the cat from the building, so I’m very keen to speak with anyone with information who might be able to tell us more. “I am also keen to find the person who owns this cat. She’s a young white female, with white patches of tabby markings on her tail, back and head. “She’s really been through it and suffering a broken jaw would have been incredibly painful for her, so I’m sure being reunited with her owners will give her a much-needed boost.” RSPCA inspectors undertake investigations when they have reason to believe that an animal cruelty or neglect offence has been committed. Unlike the police, they have no special powers to gather evidence, but they can prepare case files containing witness statements, photographs, and veterinary or other expert advice, which can be used in court.
