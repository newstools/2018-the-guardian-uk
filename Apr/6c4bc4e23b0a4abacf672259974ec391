Donald Trump’s personal attorney says he will exercise his constitutional right against self-incrimination in a lawsuit brought by a porn actor who said she had an affair with Trump. Michael Cohen filed papers in federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday saying he will assert his fifth amendment rights. Cohen asked a judge to delay the civil case after his office and residence were raided by the FBI. Federal prosecutors in New York say they are investigating Cohen’s personal business dealings. The porn actress Stormy Daniels has been seeking to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement she signed days before the 2016 presidential election so she can discuss the alleged relationship, which Trump denies. She argues it is not valid because Cohen signed it, but the president did not.
