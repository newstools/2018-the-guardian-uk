The investigation by New York Times reporters into allegations of sexual misconduct against Harvey Weinstein that led to the downfall of the Hollywood mogul is to be made into a film. The as-yet-untitled project, to which no stars or directors are yet formally attached, will focus on the work of reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who faced down intimidation and threats to reveal the scale of abuse allegedly perpetrated by one of the most influential figures in modern cinema. Weinstein’s downfall has hastened a sea change not only within Hollywood, where such misconduct had been perceived as systemic, but also within the wider world. The film will not focus on the producer and his alleged victims, but instead on the journey towards publication of Kantor and Twohey, with Oscar-winning films Spotlight and All the President’s Men cited as inspirations. It will be financed by Plan B, Brad Pitt’s company, which backed 12 Years a Slave, and by Annapurna Pictures, whose founder, Megan Ellison, has been touted as the next Harvey Weinstein. Kantor and Twohey received a Pulitzer prize for the investigation. They were awarded it jointly with Ronan Farrow, whose reporting on further testimonies by female actors alleging harassment by Weinstein was published a week later in the New Yorker. Yesterday, one of the most vocal figures alleging abuse by Weinstein claimed that representatives for the producer were still attempting to contact her. Speaking on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show, Rose McGowan said that as recently as a month ago she was receiving calls and texts from harassers she assumes were deployed by Weinstein. She is one of several women to accuse Weinstein of rape. He denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.
