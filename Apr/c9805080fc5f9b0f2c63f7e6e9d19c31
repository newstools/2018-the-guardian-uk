Harry Kane has been handed a boost in his bid for a third successive Premier League Golden Boot after being awarded Tottenham’s second goal at Stoke. The goal was given to Christian Eriksen but after Spurs appealed to the Premier League’s goal accreditation appeals panel the decision was overturned and Kane’s tally now stands at 25, four behind the leading scorer Mohamed Salah. Our second goal at @TranmereRovers last night has now been awarded to Harry Kane. https://t.co/4mAUfiYgPU The decision also means Kane’s overall total is 36, representing the most prolific season of his career. Kane was adamant he got a touch on Eriksen’s wicked free-kick at Stoke, which turned out to be the decisive moment in a 2-1 win. It was awarded to the Dane but Kane took to Twitter to appeal to Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Danny Murphy and Frank Lampard to push his case on the BBC’s Match of the Day and the Premier League have now made the change. The Premier League said in a statement: “The goal had originally been awarded to Christian Eriksen but after taking the player’s testimony into account and reviewing the match footage, a three-person panel agreed the final touch on the ball belonged to Kane.” Kane won the Golden Boot in 2015-16 and 2016-17 with 25 and 29 goals respectively but he still faces a battle for a hat-trick given the fine form of Liverpool’s Salah. The England striker, who has just returned from an ankle injury, has six games to try and haul back Salah, starting with the visit of Manchester City on Saturday. Salah, who has scored 11 goals in his last eight Premier League games, appeared to question the decision on Twitter. Just 15 minutes after the announcement, he posted: “Wooooooow really?” Another great away win. Definitely claiming that goal, flicked off my shoulder on the way in. @GaryLineker and @alanshearer will clear that one up on @BBCMOTD 😀 #COYS #THFC #PremierLeague pic.twitter.com/jIDF7cLf3d I wonder if they will give me the other 9 I also scored but were not given!!??🤣🤣 #269 #appeal https://t.co/xi2QW0bOeK
