Quentin Tarantino has filed court papers to state that he is owed over $4m in royalties from the Weinstein Company. The failed film company is currently taking bids for its assets yet before any sale is made, the film-maker has posted an objection along with a host of other big names, including Jennifer Lawrence and Jake Gyllenhaal. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the director’s lawyer has filed papers referring to “numerous uncured monetary and non-monetary defaults” that he is owed before any sale is made. He is seeking $300,000 for Grindhouse, $575,000 for Inglourious Basterds, $1.25m for Django Unchained and nearly $2.5m for The Hateful Eight. Tarantino’s long-running friendship with Harvey Weinstein was put under the spotlight after the producer was accused of sexual assault and harassment by a long list of women in the past year. “I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard,” he told the New York Times in October last year. “If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.” The film-maker cut ties with Weinstein and moved his next project, the ensemble drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, to Sony. Other stars have also involved their lawyers in the fight for royalties including Gyllenhaal, who is after money from his boxing drama Southpaw alongside co-star Rachel McAdams, as well as Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep for August Osage County. According to Deadline, an unidentified New York-based bidder is putting together an offer that would see the Weinstein Company remain an active studio as well as provide compensation for the women who claim that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.
