The US president, Donald Trump, said on Saturday a meeting with North Korea could happen over the next three to four weeks. “I think we will have a meeting over the next three or four weeks,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Washington, Michigan. “It’s going be a very important meeting, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.” “But we’ll see how it goes,” he added. “I may go in, it may not work out, I leave.” No date has been announced for a meeting and there has been intense speculation on the location of the summit, with possible hosts including Singapore, Mongolia and South Korea.

Trump said Moon and Kim had a “very good meeting” on Friday, and took credit for the historic summit, during which the leader of North Korea entered the South for the first time since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. The US president also took credit for the inter-Korean meeting, as well as saying Moon had praised his actions in making the summit possible. “I had one of the fake news groups this morning. They were saying, ‘what do you think President Trump had to do with it?’” Trump said. “I’ll tell you what. Like, how about everything?” North and South Korea agreed to a common goal of “complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula”, but many experts are wary of what Kim may demand in return for relinquishing his arsenal. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, also held a phone discussion with his South Korean counterpart and reaffirmed “the ironclad US commitment” to defend its ally “using the full spectrum of US capabilities”.
