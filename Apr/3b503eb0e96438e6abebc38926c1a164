Former first lady Barbara Bush is in “failing health” and won’t seek additional medical treatment, a Bush family spokesman said on Sunday. “Following a recent series of hospitalizations, and after consulting her family and doctors, Mrs Bush, now age 92, has decided not to seek additional medical treatment and will instead focus on comfort care,” spokesman Jim McGrath said in a news release. McGrath did not elaborate as to the nature of Bush’s health problems. She has been treated for decades for Graves’ disease, which is a thyroid condition. “It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of her failing health, worrying not for herself thanks to her abiding faith but for others,” McGrath said. “She is surrounded by a family she adores, and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving.” Bush is one of only two first ladies who was also the mother of a president. The other was Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams and mother of John Quincy Adams. She married George H W Bush in 1945. They had six children and have been married longer than any presidential couple in American history. Eight years after she and her husband left the White House, Bush stood with her husband as their son George W was sworn in as president.
