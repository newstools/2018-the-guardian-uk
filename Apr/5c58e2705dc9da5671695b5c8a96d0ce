Prosecutors in Canada have charged alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur with a seventh murder involving a missing man whose family initially thought he had abandoned his wife and two daughters. The prosecution said in court Wednesday that McArthur, a 66-year-old landscaper, has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Abdulbasir Faizi. McArthur appeared by video during the session. Police have been trying to identify the remains of several men found at a property McArthur used as storage for his landscaping business. They say he targeted men he met through dating apps that cater to gay men, meeting them at bars in the Gay Village area of Toronto, as well as male prostitutes. A relative, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she was relieved Faizi’s remains have been found. “For me at least there’s a sense of relief because he didn’t abandon anyone. He didn’t run away,” she said. Faizi, an assistant machine operator at a printing company, went missing on 29 December 2010. His Muslim family accessed his computer and discovered he had been going to bathhouses in the Gay Village and was on gay dating apps for older and large men. Police officers suggested he had just left, the relative said. Faizi’s wife divorced him, thinking he abandoned her and their two young daughters. “She didn’t know. He wasn’t out. As far as she knows they were married and they were happy and he abandoned her and the daughters,” she said. But she said she always knew he didn’t run away. “I feel very guilty now because I didn’t do enough,” she said. Police set up a taskforce called Project Houston, in 2012 after Skandaraj Navaratnam, Majeed Kayhan and Faizi, an Afghan who immigrated to Canada from Iran, went missing. The trio are south Asian or Middle Eastern. McArthur is now charged with their murders and the murders of four other men.
