Police in London are searching for two women after another female who was speaking Spanish on the night tube was viciously attacked. The 24-year-old victim was talking to friends on the Central line between Liverpool Street and Stratford when she was set upon at around 3.45am last Saturday. Her attackers shouted at her saying she should speak English when in England. They then grabbed her by the hair and pulled her around. The victim suffered injuries to her scalp and cuts to her face during the racially motivated assault, British Transport Police said. The attackers were described as being black, with braided hair and were believed to be in their late 20s. Officers are appealing for any witnesses, or anyone with information to call 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016 with reference 91 of 7 April.
