The family of the Swedish DJ Avicii, who was found dead last week, have released a statement saying he “could not go on any longer” and “he wanted to find peace”. Avicii, whose real name is Tim Bergling, was found dead in Muscat, Oman, on Friday. Omani police said no evidence of foul play had been found, although the cause of death has not been announced. Bergling’s family described the DJ and producer, who scored huge worldwide hits with Wake Me Up and Levels, as fragile and an “over-achieving perfectionist” in the second statement they have released this week. “Our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who travelled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress. When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life, to be happy and be able to do what he loved most: music.“Tim was not made for the business machine he found himself in; he was a sensitive guy who loved his fans but shunned the spotlight. Tim, you will forever be loved and sadly missed. The person you were and your music will keep your memory alive.” Earlier this week, Bergling’s family thanked his fans for their support in the days after his death when tributes poured in from them and the music industry. On Saturday, thousands gathered in Stockholm to remember him. After a minute’s silence, his most popular tracks were played and fans danced and sang. Bergling retired from live performances in 2016, after years of intense touring that exacerbated his alcoholism, though he continued his studio work. He had suffered from acute pancreatitis, which was partially blamed on his drinking. After having his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014, he cancelled a series of shows in an attempt to recover.
