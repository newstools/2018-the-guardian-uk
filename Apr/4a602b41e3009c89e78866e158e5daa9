US tech companies key asset for America; break up strengthens Chinese companies.” Really? That’s the best you’ve got? The senators need to drive this one home hard. You haven’t mentioned Chancellor. Why? He went to work for you before the story first broke in December 2015. Does his involvement not concern you? Who knew what and when?  Please ask this, America. We’ve helped you get him before Congress. Now we need your help getting answers on what happened during the EU referendum. On what possible grounds can you justify refusing an official request to appear before MPs?(Also, why won’t you entertain interview requests from the Guardian and Observer?) Last week you said it was because Cambridge Analytica didn’t use Facebook at the time, which is not true. On Tuesday you repeated it. Then after the break, you said you “mis-spoke”.

Why did you – even after you knew what Cambridge Analytica had done with your data – embed your employees with the company during the Trump campaign? On Tuesday you said you didn’t know. Are you sure? Have you had a chance to catch up on your reading?
