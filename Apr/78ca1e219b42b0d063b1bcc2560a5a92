Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with a full 40% of its population living in either Melbourne or Sydney: large, sprawling, coastal cities with very different personalities. Factoring in the other state, territory and national capitals – Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Perth and Darwin – takes that share to two-thirds of the total population of nearly 25 million. Each of these cities has its own character, typically a result of its geography or weather. There’s Perth, the westernmost city, closer to Bali than the east coast. Canberra, the flat, planned federal capital of fake lakes and roundabouts. Melbourne, with its changeable weather. Harbour-centric Sydney. Hobart, Australia’s second-oldest city. Brisbane, split by the river. Darwin, the largest city of the Northern Territory, changing character from wet season to dry. Post-industrial Adelaide. Their points of difference – down to state-specific slang – are distinct even viewed from afar, via Instagram.
