The former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont has called for dialogue with the Spanish government as he left a German prison after being granted bail. The Schleswig-Holstein district court had rejected an extradition request on a charge of rebellion for Puigdemont’s role in the campaign for Catalonia’s independence from Spain, but said extradition was possible on a lesser charge of misuse of public funds. Leaving prison on Friday, he called on Madrid to abandon its attempts to prosecute separatist leaders and urged it to enter into discussions with them. Puigdemont thanked prison staff as he emerged to cheers and people waving Catalan flags. “I claim for the immediate release of all my colleagues in Spanish prisons,” he said. “It is a shame for Europe to have political prisoners. Finally, the time for dialogue has arrived.” Puigdemont was arrested on a Spanish-issued warrant upon entering Germany on 25 March, as he attempted to drive from Finland to Belgium. The court set bail at €75,000 (£66,000). It said it considered a charge of misuse of public funds sufficient grounds for extradition, but a charge of rebellion was not, because the comparable German charge of treason specifies violence. Puigdemont’s German lawyer, Wolfgang Schomburg, said he would continue pushing for judges to rule out his extradition on the lesser charge.
