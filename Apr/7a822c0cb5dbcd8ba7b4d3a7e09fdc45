With the World Cup fast approaching, we’d like to hear from families and/ or groups of friends living all over the UK watching their home country play. Are you a Portuguese family watching in Birmingham? Are you a group of Russian friends watching in Scotland? Are you a Spanish family yelling ¡Vamos muchachos! in Sussex? Wherever you are in the UK and whoever you’re watching with, we want to photograph and interview you in your home for Guardian Weekend. If you’re interested in taking part you can use our form below. If you’re having problems seeing the form, please click here. You can read terms of service here.
