An Indian court has found a guru guilty of raping a teenage girl in 2013. The verdict against Asaram Bapu, 77, was read out inside a prison in Jodhpur due to fears that his followers might resort to violence. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. It is the latest high-profile rape case in India, following others that have fuelled public protests and raised questions about how police handle allegations and treat victims. In August last year, another popular Indian guru, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for raping two female followers. The judge, Madhusudhan Sharma, will announce the sentence for Bapu later after hearing arguments from the prosecution and his attorneys. Bapu denied raping the girl and can appeal against his conviction in a higher court. In her complaint to police in 2013, the girl accused Bapu of raping her when she visited his retreat in Jodhpur with her mother. Her family said they had been followers of Bapu for more than a decade. Bapu has been in prison since his arrest in 2013. On Wednesday, security was tight around the prison complex and in states where the guru has a strong following. Religious sects wield considerable political clout in India, with several politicians among gurusâ€™ followers. Bapu is on trial in a separate rape case along with his son, Narayan Sai. Two sisters have accused them of sexual assault.
