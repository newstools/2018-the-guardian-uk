The Seattle Seahawks are signing a quarterback to understudy starter Russell Wilson, but it’s not Colin Kaepernick. The Seahawks are signing free agent Stephen Morris, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported on Friday citing a source close to the situation. The news comes one days after it was reported the Seahawks rescinded a workout invitation to Kaepernick after he reportedly wouldn’t say whether he plans to continue kneeling in protest during the national anthem. Morris was first signed as an undrafted free agent by the Jaguars in 2014, but has never taken a live regular-season snap in stints with Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Washington. As a three-year starter at the University of Miami, Morris threw for 7,896 yards, 49 touchdowns and 30 interceptions while completing 57.7% of his passes in 36 games. In October, Kaepernick filed a lawsuit against the NFL’s owners alleging they have illegally colluded to keep him out of the league.
