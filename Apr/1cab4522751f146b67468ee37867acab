Four skiers have been killed and five others are in a critical condition after an unexpected snowstorm in the Swiss Alps forced them to spend the night outdoors. Bad weather near the Pigne dâ€™Arolla mountain caught the group of 14 skiers by surprise on Sunday, police in Valais canton said. The manager of a rest-stop in the remote mountain region called for help on Monday morning, triggering a relief operation that involved seven helicopters. Police said one of those killed was likely to have died after a fall and was found dead at the scene; three others died in hospital. Some of those not identified as being in critical condition have mild hypothermia. The skiers were Italian, French and German nationals.
