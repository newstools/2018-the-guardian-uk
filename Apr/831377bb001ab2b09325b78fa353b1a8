Police in Oman have declared there was no “criminal suspicion” in the death of Swedish dance music star Avicii, who has died aged 28. Avicii, whose real name is Tim Bergling, was found dead in Muscat on Friday 20 April, with few other details yet confirmed. Police have stated, however, that following two autopsies, no evidence of foul play has been found. Bergling had been visiting Oman on holiday. His parents and three siblings have arrived in the country, and will return with his body to his native Sweden. Thousands of fans gathered in central Stockholm over the weekend to pay tribute to the musician, who scored huge worldwide hits with Wake Me Up and Levels. Bergling had retired from live performance in 2016, after years of highly intense touring and a battle with alcoholism. “ I took on board too much negative energy,” he said after the decision. “It was the best time of my life in a sense. It came with a price – a lot of stress, a lot of anxiety for me – but it was the best journey of my life.” He continued to record music, and had another major hit in 2017 with Lonely Together, featuring Rita Ora.
