The Bayern Munich manager, Jupp Heynckes, is not picky about who his side will face in the Champions League semi-finals, after a goalless draw against Sevilla sent the German club through with a 2-1 aggregate victory to keep their hopes of a treble-winning season alive. Liverpool, Roma or Real Madrid wait in the next round but Heynckes knows Bayern face a tough encounter, regardless of their opposition. “No coach ever has a preference,” Heynckes said. “Look at what happened to Barcelona. The games will be tight. You saw in Manchester and Rome that anything can happen. You cannot underestimate any team that has qualified for a semi-final. “Of course we are ambitious and want to reach the final. The semi-final games will be tough – but we have the ambition and the motivation to face up to those challenges. “Some big teams have gone out. There are always surprises in the Champions League. I think we have a good chance. My players have big ambitions to win.” Bayern, playing in their seventh successive quarter‑final, never needed to hit top form but were in control throughout with the largely toothless Spanish side only rarely venturing into the box. The German club, who last won the treble in 2013, again under Heynckes, had secured a 2-1 advantage from the first leg in Spain. Sevilla, who beat Manchester United in the last 16, ended the game with 10 men after the dismissal in stoppage time of Joaquín Correa for a rough challenge. The result meant Sevilla, in the last eight of the European Cup for the first time since their only previous appearance at this stage 60 years ago, still managed to end Heynckes’ 12-game record winning run in the competition.
