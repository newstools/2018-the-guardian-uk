South Africa completed their first Test series win at home to Australia since readmission after thumping the beleaguered tourists by 492 runs in Johannesburg. Australia were all out for 119 in pursuit of a fanciful 612 victory target after Vernon Philander bulldozed through their batting line-up on the final morning with six wickets in the space of 32 balls. The scandal-hit tourists had promised to fight for a draw on the final day to end a controversial tour on a positive note, but their resistance lasted just 83 minutes as Philander ripped through their middle and lower order to finish with career-best figures of 6-21 and move to 204 test wickets. Darren Lehmann therefore signs off as Australia coach on a losing note and this capitulation was the final humiliation of a tour that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons. The Proteas’ 3-1 success is their first series victory on home soil over Australia since 1970. “It’s been a great journey and to go out on a high in beating the Aussies is a great feeling,” said Morne Morkel, who took the final wicket from Nathan Lyon. “We are going to celebrate hard. It’s a special bunch of boys, brothers. I’m going to miss this environment.” • Adam Collins’s full report from Johannesburg to follow
