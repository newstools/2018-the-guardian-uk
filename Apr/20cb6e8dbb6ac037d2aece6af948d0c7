The UK basked in the warmest weather of the year so far on Wednesday, with temperatures forecast to rise even higher on Thursday – and stay high into the weekend. The south-east of England enjoyed the warmest of Wednesday’s weather, with a high of 25C recorded in both Gravesend in Kent and St James’ Park in London. But Thursday’s temperatures are forecast to be even higher as the UK enjoys an unseasonably warm spell – way above April’s average maximum temperature of 11C. Temperatures reached 21.2C in Plymouth, in Devon, and 21.8C in Cardiff, south Wales. They were slightly cooler in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which saw highs of 19.7C in Kinloss, in Moray, and 18.7C in Derrylin, in County Fermanagh. Warm air from the Azores, 950 miles off the coast of Portugal, has been dragged up towards the UK by the combined efforts of an area of low pressure over the Atlantic and high pressure over western Europe, a Met Office spokesman said. But the arrival of spring sunshine should be treated with caution following the cold start to the season, Oli Claydon from the Met Office said. “After quite a dull and chilly start to spring, this is the first bout of real warm sunshine that we’ve seen. “The sun at this time of year is nearly as strong as it can be in the summer, so people just need to be cautious of that and make sure that they do look after themselves.” Runners getting ready for Sunday’s London Marathon could face challenging conditions as the temperatures threaten to beat the 1996 record of 22.7C. Offering some comfort to those competitors keen for cooler conditions, Claydon said there was a chance of some cloud cover. But he added: “There is a chance equally that we could see temperatures of 22C and maybe higher.” Sun worshippers are being advised to make the most of the warm weather, with temperatures expected to fall across the UK from the beginning of next week, and some showery outbreaks predicted.
