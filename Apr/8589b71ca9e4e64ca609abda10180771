This cauliflower dish is one I often cook at home: it is simple, light, fresh and full of flavour – the Spanish version of a Chinese stir-fry. My cooking is inspired by growing up in Spain; I learned how to make this dish at my aunt’s house in Madrid. I’m looking at putting it on the spring menu in my restaurants; with better weather hopefully arriving soon (fingers crossed!) our customers will be looking for lighter dishes. I like it on its own, but you can serve it with a pan-fried fillet of cod or salmon for a more complete meal. (Serves 4 as a tapa) 1 large cauliflower, broken into florets, leaves reservedPinch of salt200ml milkExtra-virgin olive oil, for frying5 garlic cloves, sliced50g/5 tbsp drained capers1 tsp cumin seeds½ tsp sweet smoked paprika50ml/3½ tbsp sherry or other white vinegar Place the cauliflower florets in a large pan, cover them with water, then add the salt and the milk (this will make the cauliflower whiter and prevent odours). Cook over a high heat until al dente – about eight minutes in total. Drain and refresh under cold running water, then set aside. Pour a good drizzle of oil into a cold frying pan, add the reserved cauliflower leaves, garlic, capers and cumin seeds, then turn the heat to high. When the garlic turns golden, add the paprika and the sherry vinegar. Reduce the liquid for 30 seconds, then add the cauliflower to the pan. Make sure the ingredients are well mixed and serve.
