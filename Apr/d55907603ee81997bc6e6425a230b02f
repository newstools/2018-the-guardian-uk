The pressure of being royal, and living family life on a public stage, is never shown in more stark relief than it is on the steps of the Lindo Wing. Whatever your views on the monarchy, it would be churlish not to be impressed by the grit shown, once again, by the Duchess of Cambridge as she smiled beatifically in high heels and freshly washed hair, just seven hours after giving birth. Having had a baby, and probably not much sleep – she was in labour by dawn – she looked just as serene and together as she did on the same steps after the birth of George five years ago and of Charlotte three years ago. She was even wearing earrings. It was, once again, a formidable display of her fortitude.The Lindo fashion formula is simple. For each postpartum photo call, the Duchess has worn a bespoke dress by British designer Jenny Packham. The blue polka dot dress she wore when she brought Prince George out of hospital seemed to echo the dress Princess Diana wore when William was born. This red dress with white Peter Pan collar was widely reported to “channel” Diana, who wore a red coat over a blouse with a white Peter Pan collar after the birth of Prince Harry. For an extra patriotic flourish, the red-and-white combination of the Duchess of Cambridge’s dress nodded to the new prince having arrived, with excellent timing, on St George’s Day.The Duchess wore nude heels by Gianvito Rossi, and drop pearl earrings. Prince William wore a blue shirt, as he probably always does, and as usual nobody noticed. Prince Charlotte, dressed in a perfectly traditional Liberty print dress, chose the perfect moment to show off her royal wave.
