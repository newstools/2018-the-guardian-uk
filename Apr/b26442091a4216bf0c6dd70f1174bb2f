Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo believes that baseball’s 162-game schedule is too long. The three-time All-Star said Tuesday in a radio interview on Chicago’s WMVP-AM that he thinks the season should be shorter even if it means a smaller paycheck for players. “I think we play too much baseball,” Rizzo said. “Yes, guys are going to take pay cuts. But are we playing this game for the money or do we love this game? I know it’s both, but in the long run it will make everything better.” Rizzo, 28, who has been sidelined since 6 April due to lower back stiffness, is back in the lineup for Tuesday’s night game against the St Louis Cardinals, where the forecasted temperature is around 36F. “I think playing in the cold sucks. I was thinking about this the other day. When you think of Cubs and Cardinals, you think of a beautiful Saturday at Wrigley Field. You don’t think about playing in 20 degrees,” Rizzo said. Even if the season isn’t shortened, Rizzo believes an increase in scheduled doubleheaders would allow the season to start later and in warmer temperatures. “In a perfect world, we’d start the season later and play a few scheduled doubleheaders going into an off day,” he said. “As a fan you’re going to a baseball game in April, and it’s raining, snowing and [with] freezing rain. Is it really that much fun? That’s my question.” The players negotiated for more off days in the last round of negotiations for the collective bargaining agreement, which is why this year’s season began four days earlier than normal during the middle of the last week of March. Rizzo believes a transitional period would be necessary due to the guaranteed nature of baseball’s contracts, but the impasse could be bridged by “grandfathering” old deals into the new system. “Once you start taking money from guys, that’s where it’s going to be a little more dicey,” he said.
