Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors, has revealed he struggled with depression after watching his mother’s attempted suicide and encouraged men suffering from the disease to open up and seek help. “Depression never discriminates,” the 45-year-old actor wrote to his 12.7 million Twitter followers on Monday. “Took me a long time to realize it but the key is to not be afraid to open up. Especially us dudes have a tendency to keep it in. You’re not alone.” Johnson, who is currently promoting the Warner Bros action film Rampage, told British newspaper Express on Sunday he faced his own demons after witnessing his mother’s suicide attempt as a teenager. “I reached a point where I didn’t want to do a thing or go anywhere,” the Fast & Furious film star said. “I was crying constantly.” Johnson recounted he was 15 when he watched his mother, Ata, walk into oncoming traffic on Interstate 65 in Nashville shortly after they were evicted from their apartment. He said he pulled her from the highway but then sunk into several years of depression made more difficult by injuries that halted his would-be football career and a break-up with a girlfriend. “We both healed,” Johnson said of himself and his mother, “but we’ve always got to do our best to pay attention when other people are in pain.” Johnson rose to prominence as professional wrestler The Rock in the 1990s and has considered entering politics. According to Forbes, he is Hollywood’s second-highest paid actor, earning $65m in 2017. In the UK and Ireland, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.
