Mark Cavendish, who has his eyes on a 31st stage win in the Tour de France, is hoping to return to racing for the Amgen Tour of California between 13 and 19 May after a series of crashes in February and March culminated in a dramatic spill at Milan‑San Remo that left the Manxman with a fractured rib and damage to an ankle. “I’d like at least to make California. That’s another six weeks away, so I should be all right,” the 2011 world road race champion, who has spent part of this week in Belgium receiving treatment from his team physios at the Dimension Data squad, told the Observer. “I don’t know how my fitness will be but I should be all right. At least if I can come back by then I should be all right for the Tour.” Cavendish has yet to ride his bike on the road but has managed up to one hour on a home trainer; even before the San Remo crash his build-up to the spring had been disrupted by falls at the Abu Dhabi Tour, where he suffered concussion, and the Tirreno Adriatico stage race, where he fractured another rib. “I’m pretty happy to be back on the turbo trainer after a crash like that. I’ve been riding through the pain to do it.” He has, however, been forced to miss the Commonwealth Games for the second time in a row. “I’m proud to be from the Isle of Man. I don’t usually get to ride for the Island and I had to miss it last time, so I was looking forward to it. I know we have a strong team, so it would have been good.” At Milan-San Remo Cavendish flew through the air after colliding with a traffic bollard 10km from the finish, with the race at its most intense. “I know that roundabout – it’s quite a famous point in San Remo, a bit of a pinch point, there were just too many guys being pinched. I knew I was going down before I hit it so I was able to brace myself for it so it could actually have been a lot worse. It didn’t feel great but I’m lucky with the injuries I’ve got, I’m pretty fortunate.”
