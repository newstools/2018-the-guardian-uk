When pop megastar Taylor Swift publicly revealed her political leanings on Sunday night, praising two Democratic congressional candidates in her home state of Tennessee, she was breaking with a years-long policy of keeping her politics to herself. Her endorsements drew much praise, but also a fierce backlash: some white supremacists who have formed an odd cult following around the singer cried betrayal, while some more mainstream fans said she should have stuck to her music. Criticism is nothing new for Swift, whose prior political silence has drawn just as much vitriol as her decision now to speak out. In an Instagram post on Sunday night, Swift threw her support behind Phil Bredesen, the Democratic candidate for Senate, and Jim Cooper for the House of Representatives. She wrote: “In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions. I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. “I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.” Swift, 28, has previously maintained her girl-next-door image while staying scrupulously neutral in the political fights of the day, a decision that had frustrated many liberals. Swift had said that as a young woman whose expertise was in music, she didn’t feel right influencing her fans’ politics. “I don’t talk about politics because it might influence other people. And I don’t think that I know enough yet in life to be telling people who to vote for,” she told Time magazine six years ago. I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈 A post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 7, 2018 at 4:33pm PDT On the day of the 2016 election, she urged fans to vote, but did not reveal how she would cast her own ballot, though there was plenty of evidence they wanted to know: “Who is Taylor Swift voting for?” was a top search on Google. She inched closer to revealing a liberal orientation when she tweeted support for last year’s Women’s March, saying: “So much love, pride, and respect for those who marched. I’m proud to be a woman today, and every day.” That wasn’t enough for critics, who questioned why she didn’t actually attend the march as many other celebrities did. One writer called her comments a “craven” way of “reducing the political protest to a girl power party”. Swift’s public neutrality allowed fans to project whatever views they wanted on to her. She developed a following among white supremacists, who held her up as the platonic ideal of white femininity. The singer’s lawyers went after a blogger who tied her to white supremacy, and critics wondered why she wouldn’t publicly denounce her neo-Nazi fans. Swift even sparked controversy with a short Instagram post marking her birthday at the end of 2017, where she said she “couldn’t have asked for a better year”. Commentators who saw little to celebrate in the tumultuous first year of Donald Trump’s presidency begged to differ. With all that history, it’s no surprise that Swift’s decision to finally wade into politics sparked some backlash of its own. Those rightwing fans, for one, were incensed. “Oh yay! Another literally retarded celebrity the left can fawn over while we make fun of her and them for being retarded,” wrote one poster on the often-controversial online message board 4chan. “Taylor swift just ended her entire career lmao,” [sic] another poster wrote, while a third chimed in: “Guys I think those f------ cultists who tortment [sic] us killed Taylor swift and replaced her with a brain dead [non-playable character]. Those f------ have gone too far this time. I will defend the honor of my lady Taylor Swift and find a way to return her to normal.” Mainstream Republicans were also displeased, posting a response where they promised she would not be able to, in the words of one of her hit songs, “shake it off”. “If you haven’t heard, multimillionaire pop star Taylor Swift came down from her ivory tower to tell hardworking Tennesseans to vote for Phil Bredesen,” said the post by the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Charlie Kirk, president of the conservative group, Turning Point USA, tweeted: “You just endorsed a Democrat in the Tennessee senate race with a ridiculous statement saying Marsha Blackburn, a woman, is against women. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Your career has never recovered since Kanye ended it.” But Swift’s endorsements drew plenty of support as well. Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner said on Twitter: “A big shout out to Taylor Swift for speaking out. You can single handedly change this country. Impress on your fans how critical and powerful their voices are. If you get them to the polls on Nov 6, everything you care about will be protected.” Swift’s history with rapper Kanye West – who memorably interrupted her speech at an awards show, and has since morphed into a prominent Trump supporter – provided plenty of grist for delighted Democrats as well. Scott Dworkin, co-founder of the anti-Trump Democratic Coalition: “Taylor Swift just took the mic from Kanye.” It remains to be seen how much impact Swift’s endorsement will have in the races for the midterm elections in November. Swift is a registered Tennessee voter with legions of fans, but celebrity endorsements have not always given candidates a decisive edge. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton got late-hour support from Jay-Z and Beyoncé in Ohio, Bruce Springsteen in Pennsylvania, and Jennifer Lopez in Florida. All three states went for Trump.
