Mo Farah sprinted away in the final mile to smash the European record and claim victory in the Chicago marathon. As he crossed the line he blew kisses to the crowd before doing the Mobot and jumping into his wife Tania’s arms. Not everyone had thought that Farah would be able to make the leap from track to marathon, especially in his mid-30s. Farah’s time of 2 hours 5 minutes and 11 seconds – a personal best by 70 seconds – was a clinical rebuttal. What made Farah’s performance more impressive was that he seemed to be drifting off the pace after 18 miles, and also appeared to grimace in pain after stumbling over a water bottle a couple of miles later. “It was amazing to cross the line first,” he admitted afterwards. “This is a major marathon. It was nice to be able to race against Galen and the rest of the guys. I wasn’t sure about the pace at the start because the conditions wasn’t great but we picked it up.” Second was the Ethiopian Mosinet Geremew, who clung on with Farah for most of the race, in 2:05:24 while the Japanese runner Suguru Osako was third in 2:05:50. That time broke his country’s national record – and earned him 100m yen bonus (£670,000) from his government. The Kenyan woman Brigid Kosgei won the women’s race in 2:18:35.
