The former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has appeared in court again, facing a third round of criminal charges relating to the 1MDB corruption scandal that saw billions in government money stolen. At a court in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, Najib, who was defeated in a shock election in May, was charged with six counts of criminal breach of trust relating to $1.59bn of government funds used for illicit means. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. It brings to 38 the total number of charges against Najib, who has already pleaded not guilty to dozens of fraud, corruption and money laundering charges over the 1MDB scandal, described as the biggest in Malaysia’s history. Prosecutors allege billions of dollars were embezzled and lavishly spent around the globe on luxury property, a private yacht, Hollywood films and extravagant shopping sprees. Najib had previously cleared himself of all wrongdoing but the new administration, led by 93-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, reopened the investigation into the scandal, leading to multiple arrests. The former Malaysian treasury secretary general Irwan Serigar was jointly charged with Najib on Thursday. Najib’s lawyer, Shafee Abdullah, said in court he was “delighted” to hear the charges, which he described as “atrocious”. “We are looking forward to defending him,” said Shafee. The new charges come a month after Najib was slapped with 25 counts in connection with the sum of $681m that went into his personal bank account. Najib’s wife, Rosmah Mansour, also pleaded not guilty this month to 17 charges of money laundering related to the 1MDB investigation. All of Najib’s new charges carry jail terms of two to 20 years. If found guilty Najib was already facing jail time of more than 200 years and fines in the tens of millions for the 32 previous charges. Najib has elected to face trial for all of the charges and the first court dates are set for February 2019.
