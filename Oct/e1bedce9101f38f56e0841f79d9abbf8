Simone Biles is now an 11-time world champion after leading the USA women to team gold at the World Gymnastics Championships in Doha on Tuesday. Biles had the highest individual score in the entire competition on the floor, uneven bars and vault as the US recorded a total of 171.269, with Russia second on 162.863 and China winning bronze with 162.396. Biles’s only blemish came on the beam where she made a few small errors. However, her compatriot Kara Eaker produced a strong showing to record the best score of the competition in the discipline. Biles’s achievements are all the more remarkable given that she has been suffering severe pain from a kidney stone. She was admitted to hospital at the weekend for the complaint but left without passing the stone, which she called the “Doha pearl”. “We had to go to the ER, because I’ve been having stomach pains on my right side for two days,” Biles said at the weekend. “We started to think it was my appendix, so we wanted to go as a precaution. We got tests done and they found a kidney stone. I’m in a bit of pain [today], so adrenaline helps.” Simone Biles continues to produce the goods @DohaGym2018 - this Vault scored 15.500 and has helped the USA 🇺🇸 into an early lead in the Women's Team Final#GoGymtastic #Gymnastics #DohaGym2018 pic.twitter.com/6ErxF47KwQ The 21-year-old has another five events to compete in this week, which could take her haul of world championship medals to a record-equalling 20. Biles already has four Olympic golds to her name and has spoken of her intent to compete at the 2020 Games in Tokyo. She has also become a strong voice for change within gymnastics following the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal.
