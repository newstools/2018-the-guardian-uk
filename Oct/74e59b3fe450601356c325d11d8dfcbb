My mum would never let me leave for school without breakfast. But sometimes I’d stop at the cornershop on my way and get a little something extra – a maple pecan twist or a flapjack. They had so many flavours to choose from: coconut, raspberry, lemon meringue. But not maple pecan blueberry with a pretzel base. That’s my invention. Enjoy. Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 10 minServes 8-10 For the base135g unsalted butter140g digestive biscuits 70g pretzels2 tbsp golden caster sugar For the flapjack375g unsalted butter210g demerara sugar 60ml golden syrup 60ml maple syrup 1 tsp vanilla bean paste ½ tsp fine salt300g porridge oats210g jumbo rolled oats10g pecansZest of 1 lemon135g self-raising flour½ tsp ground cinnamon300g blueberries For the glaze150g icing sugar, sifted40ml double cream30ml milk 2 tbsp maple syrup Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Grease and line a 27cm x 20cm baking tray. For the base, melt the butter in a medium pan, crumble the digestives and pretzels into the pan, add the caster sugar and stir. Tip the mixture into the lined tray, press it so it’s even, and bake for 15 minutes. Put the butter, sugar, both syrups, vanilla bean paste and the salt in a saucepan, then melt gently over a low heat. In a separate bowl, combine the oats, pecans, lemon zest, flour and cinnamon, and mix well. Pour the sugary butter over the dry ingredients, mix well, and finally fold in the blueberries. Tip the flapjack mix over the base, press gently so it’s level, and bake for 50 minutes, until golden brown. Take out of the oven and leave to cool. For the glaze, combine all the ingredients and whisk until the mixture thickens. Once the flapjack has fully cooled, squiggle the glaze all over the top and eat.
