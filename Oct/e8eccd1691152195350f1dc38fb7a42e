José Mourinho retains the backing of Manchester United, with the board currently having no plans to remove him as manager. United play Newcastle United in Saturday’s late game at Old Trafford and according to multiple club sources Mourinho still has the support of the hierarchy for the immediate future. On Friday night a report claimed that Mourinho would be sacked whatever the result against Newcastle. This has also been dismissed by the club. Poor performances have been compounded by off-field problems during an uncomfortable start to the season at Old Trafford, with the relationship between Mourinho and record signing Paul Pogba creating unwanted headlines. Last weekend’s 3-1 loss at West Ham made this United’s worst start to a league campaign in 29 years but senior sources at the club have strongly denied that the Portuguese will be fired this weekend. Mourinho’s team has failed to win its last four matches, a run that has occurred only once since 1999. If the sequence is not broken this afternoon it will be the first time since the 1989-90 season there have been five home matches without victory.
