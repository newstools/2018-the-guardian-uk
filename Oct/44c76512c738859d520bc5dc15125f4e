Kylian Mbappé is the hot favourite to become the first player to win two Golden Boy awards after the France forward was named on the 40-strong shortlist to decide Europe’s best young player. Organised by the Italian newspaper Tuttosport and awarded to Europe’s most impressive footballer under the age of 21, the Golden Boy award was founded in 2003 and relates to performances across a calendar year not a season, with the winner decided by a panel of 30 journalists. Mbappé, who beat France teammate Ousmane Dembélé and Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford to win the prize last year, was also crowned Best Young Player at the 2018 World Cup and is expected to see off competition from the likes of Christian Pulisic of Borussia Dortmund, Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt and Roma’s Justin Kluivert. Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool); Kelvin Amian (Toulouse); Houssem Aouar (Lyon); Musa Barrow (Atalanta); Justin Bijlow (Feyenoord); Josip Brekalo (Wolfsburg); Patrick Cutrone (AC Milan); Dani Olmo (Dinamo Zagreb); Tom Davies (Everton);  Matthijs De Ligt (Ajax); Moussa Diaby (PSG); Diogo Dalot (Manchester United); Moussa Djenepo (Standard Liege); Ritsu Doan (Groningen); Eder Militao (Porto); Odsonne Edouard (Celtic); Evander (Midtjylland);  Phil Foden (Manchester City); Achraf Hakimi (Borussia Dortmund); Amadou Haidara (Red Bull Salzburg); Joao Felix (Benfica); Jota (Benfica); Jovane Cabral (Sporting CP) Dejan Joveljic (Red Star Belgrade); Boubacar Kamara (Marseille); Moise Kean (Juventus); Jules Keita (Dijon); Justin Kluivert (Roma); Alban Lafont (Fiorentina); Manu Garcia (Toulouse); Kylian Mbappé (PSG); Pietro Pellegri (Monaco); Christian Pulisic (Borussia Dortmund); Marcelo Saracchi (RB Leipzig); Ismaila Sarr (Rennes); Dayot Upamecano (RB Leipzig); Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid); Moussa Wagué (Barcelona); Timothy Weah (PSG); Nicolo Zaniolo (Roma) Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is one of only three English players on the shortlist, along with Everton’s Tom Davies and Manchester City teenager Phil Foden but there is no place for Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho or Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon. Diego Dalot, who joined Manchester United in the summer for £19m, is the only other Premier League player to make the list – a significant reduction on last year’s nine in total. Wayne Rooney and Raheem Steling are the only English winners having picked up the prize in 2004 and 2014 respectively. Other previous winners include Lionel Messi (2005), Sergio Agüero (2007) and Paul Pogba (2013). The 40-man list will be reduced to 20 in November, with the winners being announced in December.
