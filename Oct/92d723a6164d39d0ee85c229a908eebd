Danny Cipriani’s bad week got considerably worse when the fly-half rejected by England was sent off for a high tackle during Gloucester’s Champions Cup defeat at Munster. Cipriani caught Rory Scannell in the face with his shoulder and as soon as the incident was referred to the TMO the Gloucester man knew he would be sent off under the current directive against aggressive contact with an opponent’s head. The referee had no option and Cipriani apologised as he went off. The discarded England fly-half is the Premiership player of the month but was still omitted by Eddie Jones for the autumn Test squad. The Irish province ran in five tries as they emerged 36-22 victors against the battling Cherry and Whites. Gallagher Premiership leaders Exeter fell to a shock 29-25 loss at French outfit Castres, despite the dismissal of Maama Vaipulu in the 36th minute for the hosts.
