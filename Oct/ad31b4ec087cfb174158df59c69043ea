I have just switched to a Windows desktop computer and need to get a good monitor – about 21 inches and under £200. Do you have any advice? Keith There are two ways to pick a monitor, and it’s worth using both approaches. The first is to go into a shop and see which one looks best. It’s much easier to compare screens side by side. The second is to compile a table of specifications and pick the monitor that meets your needs. Reading spec sheets doesn’t guarantee that you’ll find a monitor that looks good, but this generally isn’t a problem nowadays. The quality of flat screens has improved dramatically over the past 10-15 years, and it’s quite hard to find a bad one, unless it’s a faulty product.The prices of standard PC monitors and flat screen TVs have also fallen dramatically. Monitors start at less than £100 and you can get a good one for less than £150. Of course, you can pay up to £1,000 for a bigger, faster, high-resolution screen, but you don’t need that sort of monitor unless you’re a keen gamer or a video editor. There’s one specification to watch out for: some cheap monitors have TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD screens. They are not necessarily bad, but IPS (In Plane Switching) and LED backlit screens are brighter and have richer colours.In general, a brightness of around 200 candela per square metre, “200 nits”, is enough for use in normal indoor lighting, and 120-200 cd/m2 used to be common. However, there’s a trend towards brighter screens, with 500cd/m2 being preferred for movies. HDTV sets go even higher.If a screen is too bright, you can always turn it down. Only if it’s too dim do you have a problem. Today’s standard PC monitor has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which matches the TV industry definitions for 1080p and Full High Definition (Full HD) movies. As prices have come down, some people are moving to Quad HD (2560 x 1440) and Ultra HD (3840 x 2160). There are also ultra-wides (2560 x 1080) that avoid having two screens side by side.Normal screen sizes vary from around 21.5in to 28in, and 24in is currently the sweet spot. Most of these screens have the same 1920 x 1080 resolution, so you won’t fit any more information on a bigger screen. However, everything on the screen will be slightly bigger and easier to read. Against that, a bigger screen will also have fewer pixels per inch (ppi), so it will look less sharp.Unless you’re on a tight budget, there’s not much point in buying anything smaller than 24in, because you won’t save any space. In fact, today’s small bezels provide bigger screens without increasing the overall size of the monitor.But if you decide on a 27in or larger screen, go for Quad HD resolution instead of Full HD … or sit further away from the screen. Most flat screens have a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is fine for most purposes. Doubling it to 120Hz makes things smoother, but it means your PC has to send the screen twice as many frames per second. A PC that runs a popular game at, say, 88fps isn’t going to make it, even if the monitor can handle it.It’s clearly better to have a screen with a higher refresh rate, but it doesn’t make much practical difference for people who aren’t gamers. Obviously, you have to connect the screen to your PC, and there are lots of ways to do that. The main ones for your purposes are VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI. Check your PC to see which ones you can use.You’re unlikely to need VGA or DVI unless you have an old PC. HDMI and, especially, DisplayPort are better options. HDMI came from the TV industry and royalty-free DisplayPort from the PC industry. In both cases, the version level can be important.With HDMI, even version 1.4 – from 2009 – can handle 1440p at 60Hz, which should be enough for your purposes. But it would be better to for look for v2.0 from 2013, if not last year’s v2.1.With DisplayPort, look for version 1.2 (from 2010) or later. The spec is now up to v1.4, but even the first version (from 2006) supported both Full HD and Quad HD screens at 60Hz. Monitor manufacturers offer all kinds of features to make products more attractive to some users. Examples include curved screens, built-in speakers, built-in TV decoders, USB ports, and so on. Most of them also increase the price, so don’t buy them if you don’t need them.Some people prefer monitors with stands that let you raise, lower or tilt the screen easily. There’s also the time-honoured workaround of standing the monitor on a couple of books.Nvida’s G-Sync and AMD’s Freesync are “adaptive sync technologies” built into some monitors. They make sure your graphics card and monitor refresh at the same time, which can reduce input lag and “screen tearing” (where parts of the image don’t line up correctly). These features are aimed at gamers, but if they don’t cost extra, there’s no harm in having them. I don’t see or use enough different monitors to provide a reliable guide to the best buys, and impressions based on seeing monitors at press conferences, trade shows and popular retailers could be misleading. Caveat emptor.However, regular readers will know that I’ve spent a couple of decades using Dell desktop PCs with Dell monitors. They will not be surprised that I like the Dell U2417H UltraSharp monitor, which has tiny bezels, excellent colour and contrast, and a fully adjustable stand.At £218.40, Dell’s current price busts your budget, but eBuyer sells it for £199.97, and other sources may charge less.UltraSharp is the top of Dell’s four ranges of monitors, but it sells two dozen Full HD monitors for less than £200, starting with the 22in SE2216H at £99.98. The 21.5in SE2219H is a much newer alternative, available for £99.99 on Amazon, and would probably do all you need. There’s also an S2218H with built-in speakers for £123.61.Apart from that, I’ve been generally impressed by Asus, Samsung, LG and AOC monitors, which gives you lots of options to look at. I’ve previously recommended the 24in Asus VS248HR gaming monitor, which is great value at £110.96. However, the non-gaming 23.8in Asus VZ249HE might be a better pick for your purposes, at £116.28.If you would like to try a curved screen, the 24in Samsung C24F396 is a great choice at £119, and you can look at one in Currys PC World. The not-curved 24in S24F356 is an attractive alternative at £129. The 22in S22F352 has the sole advantage of being cheap at £83.83.It’s not what you asked for, but you can actually afford a budget ultrawide monitor, in the form of the LG 25UM58 at £149.97.Ultrawides have the same pixel height as Full HD screens, but extend the edges to provide a resolution of 2560 x 1080 pixels. This works well if you have a 34in monster of a screen, but I imagine a 25in version would be like looking through a letterbox.I wouldn’t recommend a 25in ultrawide without seeing one, and I’ve never seen one. The price makes it interesting, but if you can’t afford a 34in version, 29in (£242.23) would be a better bet.Have you got a question?
