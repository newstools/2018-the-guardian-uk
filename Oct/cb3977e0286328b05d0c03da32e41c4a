A British adventurer has become the fastest woman to cycle around the world. Jenny Graham circumnavigated the globe in 124 days, knocking nearly three weeks off the previous record. The 38-year-old from Inverness arrived at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on Thursday. She managed the feat in 20 days fewer than the 144 it took Italy’s Paola Gianotti in 2014. “I just set out to see how far I could go. The furthest I’ve cycled before was from Land’s End to John O’Groats, now I have cycled right around the world,” Graham said. “It’s sometimes been tough, but I thrive on challenges on the road and of course it has also been so amazing.” Graham started her journey in Berlin on 16 June and cycled 15 hours a day unsupported and carrying all her kit. She averaged 156 miles a day. “I knew I wanted to do something solo to test my physical and mental ability. I am the fittest I have ever been, so I thought I’d train hard and give it a go. Here I am back in Berlin, I can hardly believe it,” she said. Graham’s compatriot and the men’s record holder, Mark Beaumont, offered his “heartfelt congratulations” on Thursday. The Edinburgh-based cyclist, who completed the feat in 2017, said: “Just phenomenal riding and all the way with a smile, with a cheer, with a sense of humility and the excitement of the unknown around the corner.” The 18,000-mile route took Graham across four continents and through 16 countries. From Germany, she travelled through Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Russia, Mongolia and China. She also passed through Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the US, Portugal and Spain before heading back to Germany via France, Belgium and Holland. Her journey included four flights and a boat.
