You will need 4 pork steaks, each approximately 125g in weight. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Put the steaks on a work surface and place a heaped tablespoon of nduja (about 50g) on each, spreading it thickly over the meat. Roll the steak up into a plump sausage and secure with a wooden skewer or a couple of cocktail sticks. Repeat with the remaining steaks and nduja. Put the pork on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, basting occasionally with the bright red, spicy oil that comes from the nduja. Remove the stalks from 400g of spinach leaves. Wash the leaves thoroughly, then, while they are still wet, put them in a saucepan over a moderate to high heat, cover tightly with a lid and leave to cook in their own steam for 2-3 minutes until dark green and wilted. Drain the spinach and squeeze out the water with your hands. Put the spinach in a saucepan, add 200ml of double cream, a grating of nutmeg and a seasoning of salt and black pepper. Bring to a bubble, then process briefly in a blender or food processor. Spoon the spinach sauce between 2 plates, then serve the pork steaks on the spinach. Enough for 2. You may need to bat the steaks out a little if they are too thick to stuff and roll. I don’t own a cutlet bat, so make do by wrapping the steaks in clingfilm and beating them firmly with a rolling pin. It is essential to baste the meat with the fat that leaks from the nduja. The nduja is spicy (and the heat can vary from brand to brand) so the creamy spinach is there to balance the heat. You could make a tomato sauce if you prefer, crushing cherry tomatoes and a few rosemary needles with olive oil and cooking for 10 minutes before adding the cream. No nduja? Skinned chorizo mashed to a paste will work a treat. Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
