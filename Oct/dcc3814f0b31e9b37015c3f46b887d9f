Donald Trump suspects his defense secretary, General Jim Mattis, might be a Democrat and “could be” heading for the exit. Trump was responding to a specific question from journalist Lesley Stahl, for an interview to air Sunday night on CBS News’ 60 Minutes, about whether Mattis was “going to leave”. “Well, I don’t know,” the president said. “He hasn’t told me that.” “Do you want him to?” Stahl pressed. “I have a very good relationship with him,” Trump said. “I had lunch with him two days ago. I have a very good relationship with him. “It could be that he is. I think he’s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That’s Washington.” Mattis was a US Marines commander in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was elevated under George W Bush to command the United States Joint Forces Command. Under Barack Obama, he became commander of US Central Command. The defense department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its first two years, the Trump administration has witnessed an unprecedented flow of high-profile departures. This week, UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced she was stepping down. In a book published last month, journalist Bob Woodward depicted Mattis as directly ignoring an expressed desire by Trump to assassinate Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and comparing Trump’s understanding of tensions on the Korean peninsula to that of “a fifth- or sixth-grader”. Mattis denied making such statements. The defense secretary is scheduled to embark for Vietnam on Tuesday in a trip that originally included a Beijing agenda, since canceled.
