Simone Biles was dominant in qualifying at the world gymnastics championships in Doha, despite being admitted to hospital with a kidney stone on the eve of the event. The reigning Olympic champion easily posted the top all-around score of 60.965 during the early portions of qualifying on Saturday, after leaving hospital without passing a stone she has dubbed the “Doha pearl”. “We had to go to the ER, because I’ve been having stomach pains on my right side for two days,” Biles said in a video posted online by USA Gymnastics. “We started to think it was my appendix, so we wanted to go as a precaution. We got tests done and they found a kidney stone. I’m in a bit of pain [today], so adrenaline helps.” Biles posted the highest individual scores on the beam, vault and floor, and was second on uneven bars through five of 11 qualifying groups. Biles’s performance also helped the USA guarantee their place in the team final – they are already more than 12 points clear of second-placed Japan at the halfway stage in qualifying. We were pretty good,” Biles said. “We tried to stay focused just like in practice, because practices have been going really well. Hopefully we’ll go out there and kill it again [on Sunday].” Biles stunned the Aspire Academy crowd in Qatar with an astounding opening vault, completing a combination only previously been done in competition by men. Her score of 15.966 was the highest of the day on any event by a massive margin. The 10-time world champion had tweeted from her hospital bed on Friday, saying: “Nothing like a late night ER visit less than 24 hrs before world championships. This kidney stone can wait... doing it for my team!” Biles, who won four Olympic gold medals at Rio 2016, is expected to compete in five individual finals as well as the team final over the next seven days, as she bids to add to her total of 14 world championship medals.
