The American author and wit Mark Twain stipulated that his autobiography should not be published complete until a century after his death, which is why the first of three unexpurgated volumes documenting his life did not appear until 2010. Happily, Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood has no such inhibitions and this week publishes the third volume of his memoirs – In Strictest Confidence – taking its place alongside All Balls and Glitter (2008) and Tales from the Dance Floor (2013) in the pantheon. Each is a prolific and acerbic chronicler of the imperfections of their respective ages, but can you tell which is which when this unlikely twain meet?
