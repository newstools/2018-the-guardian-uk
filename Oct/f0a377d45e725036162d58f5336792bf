So it seems the people at the Ecuadorian embassy in London have had it with Julian Assange loitering around their pad, after it was revealed he has been told to take better care of his cat and clean his bathroom. In a gloriously petty move, they have even limited his wi-fi usage. Genius. We have all been there, right? Any of us who have survived the second year of uni knows the horror of the wrong roommate. I mean, you could just ask them to leave, but it is way more fun, in my experience, to make life so unbearable that they are convinced they are going of their own volition.

Each of the five senses must be covered. If that fails, urinate.
