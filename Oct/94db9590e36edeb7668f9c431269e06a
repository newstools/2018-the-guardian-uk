Enable, last year’s winner of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, has been given an ideal draw in stall six ahead of her attempt to become only the second horse since 1978 to take successive runnings of Europe’s most prestigious race. The ballot was not so kind to the second-favourite Sea Of Class, however, and James Doyle will be leaving stall 15, towards the outside of the 19-strong field, on William Haggas’s filly. The draw can be highly significant in big fields at Longchamp, where horses caught wide can lose vital ground, for instance as the field turns into a “false” straight for about a furlong before rounding the home turn. Four horses were quoted at 20-1 or shorter for Sunday’s race before the draw – Enable, Sea Of Class, Andre Fabre’s Waldgeist and the St Leger winner, Kew Gardens – and Enable was the only one of the four to get a single-figure stall towards the rail. Waldgeist will start from 13 while Kew Gardens and Ryan Moore are drawn 14. Enable has already been trimmed from 5-4 to 11-10 following the draw, and she could well set off as an odds-on favourite on Sunda. Sea Of Class is a 7-2 chance while Waldgeist is 7-1, Kew Gardens is 12-1 in a place and it is 33-1 bar the four. There is a distinctly autumnal – indeed, almost wintry – feel to the domestic cards, with two meetings over jumps and two on the all-weather Flat. And there is also, for only the second time since October 2014, a walkover on a British track after two of the original three declarations for the beginners’ chase at Warwick were taken out of the race this morning. It is not difficult to imagine a few conspiracy theories swirling around as, astonishingly, the owner of Dan Skelton’s Desirable Court, the last horse standing, is none other than Craig Buckingham, victim of the fiasco at Nottingham on Wednesday when his runner Magic Pulse was mistakenly taken out of a valuable sprint handicap. Buckingham will pick up just over £5,000 so long as Desirable Court gets to the track and proves she is sound. The way his luck is running at the moment, though, what price the horsebox breaks down? The walkover is disappointing for racegoers, who expect to see at least six races on any card in Britain. It is also a little embarrassing for the sport that any race can attract such a meagre turnout, regardless of whether it then loses two-thirds of the declarations. Prize money is supposed to be the reward for helping to put on a show, not dished out when there’s no show at all. But the older punters among us will recall that one-horse races have never been commonplace, walkovers are a much rarer occurrence now than they were in the past. This is the first since April 2017, while the most recent walkover before that was in July 2012. And there were four in 2011 alone. In this respect at least, the efforts put into making the racing programme more competitive in recent years seems to have paid off, and that includes investments in watering systems and turf management that have effectively banished very firm and hard ground from the racing lexicon. In the races that actually have some runners at Warwick, Lissycasey (2.10) and Chieftain’s Choice (3.50) should both go well, while So Hi Class (3.25) and Silver Swift (4.30) are solid picks on the all-weather at Lingfield and Molten Lava (7.45) is an interesting 6-1 chance at Chelmsford.
