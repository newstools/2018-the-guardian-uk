Bake two large sweet potatoes on a baking sheet at 200C/gas mark 6 for approximately 50 minutes until they are soft to the touch. Peel and roughly chop a couple of medium-sized onions, then put them in a deep pan with 2 tbsp of olive oil, and cook over a moderate heat for a good 20 minutes until they are soft. Stir them from time to time. Peel and finely slice 3 cloves of garlic, add them to the softened onions, followed by 2 tsp of smoked paprika, 1 tsp of ground turmeric and 2 tsp of garam masala. Cook briefly, then add 100g of brown lentils and 500ml of water. Bring to the boil then lower the heat to a simmer. Leave at a gentle bubble for 10 minutes, then add 100g of small orange lentils and continue cooking until all is soft and tender – about 10 to 15 minutes. Beat the mixture with a wooden spoon, crushing some of the softer orange lentils as you go, then check the seasoning, adding more salt and pepper as necessary. Split the cooked sweet potatoes in half and spoon over the lentils. A few coriander leaves – or even mint – would be appropriate here. For 2. The mild spiciness of the lentils works particularly well with the sweet potato, but you could use a couple of large Maris Pipers or King Edwards if you prefer. The texture of the lentil sauce is at its most pleasing when somewhere between soup and dal. Watch the liquid levels as it cooks, adding more water or turning up the heat to reduce and thicken as necessary. You could speed everything up by using canned or bottled beans instead of the lentils. My suggestion would be haricot or cannellini beans. A few cherry tomatoes will thicken and enrich the sauce, adding a welcome, sweet-sour note. Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
