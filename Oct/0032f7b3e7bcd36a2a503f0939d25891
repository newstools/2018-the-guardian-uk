Another suspicious package bound for CNN was discovered on Monday morning, the network said. The package was intercepted at a post office in Atlanta, where the network is headquartered, according to a statement from CNN’s president, Jeff Zucker. “There is no imminent danger to the CNN Center,” Zucker said. Two of the pipe bombs sent last week to prominent political figures were addressed to CNN. Cesar Sayoc, a Donald Trump supporter from Florida, was arrested and charged with sending the devices. It was unclear if the latest package was part of the same pattern. Authorities said last week that even after Sayoc was arrested, additional devices might be found that had already been placed in the mail. CNN’s New York office was evacuated for hours last week after one of the pipe bombs was found there. Since then, the network has instituted additional mail security. “All mail, at all CNN domestic bureaus, is being screened at offsite facilities as of last Wednesday, so this package would NOT have come directly to the CNN Center, even if it hadn’t been intercepted first,” Zucker said. “Our screening process is working and we will keep you updated as we learn more.”
