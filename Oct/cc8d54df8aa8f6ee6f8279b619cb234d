Four Jacksonville Jaguars players have been detained and released after an incident at a London nightclub. The Jaguars are in London to play the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The players are alleged to have tried to leave the London Reign Showclub in the early hours of Saturday without paying their £50,000 ($64,000) tab. They were stopped from leaving by the nightclub’s security team and detained by police for nine hours before being released, according to the Sun. The Jaguars confirmed the players had been detained in a statement on Saturday. “The matter is being resolved and the players are with the team,” the Jaguars said. “Any discipline will be handled internally.” The incident comes during a disappointing season for the Jaguars. They were expected to be a Super Bowl contender but have lost their last three games, and their quarterback, Blake Bortles, was benched last week after a series of mistakes.
