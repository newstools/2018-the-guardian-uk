This picture, of dancers on top of the Asakusa theatre, was taken in 1949, after the collapse of the military dictatorship in Japan, when the population was still coming to terms with the reality of brutal defeat in the war. Tokyo was being reimagined and photography played a crucial role in the rebirth. Years of censorship had ended and new magazines and newspapers promoted more objective reporting. A young generation of documentary photographers was emerging, borrowing the imported style of Life magazine, and reflecting the realities of Japan back to its population. Takeyoshi Tanuma quickly became prominent among these photographers. He was only in his 20s when he took this picture. The two women are part of an all-female dance troupe that had been resident at the theatre since it was built in 1937. Tanuma’s composition shows them turning their backs on the dustier cast of the city – the makeshift housing, unweeded yards and the crowded walled graveyard – as they engross themselves in the glossier pages of a magazine. The dance troupe had, by 1949, begun to share billing with the latest Hollywood movies at the Asakusa. Those fantasies seem part of the young dancers’ fashion sense. They have snuck out to the rooftop, and the ribbons in their hair seem to want to lift them higher still. Tanuma, now 89, continued to take photographs of his native city as it transformed itself so dramatically through the subsequent decades. A collection of them was published in 1980, in which he was described as “the Japanese Cartier-Bresson”; in 1994 he became a professor at the Tokyo College of Photography. This picture is included in Ravens and Red Lipstick, a survey of Japanese photography since 1945. In retrospect, it seems to hold a few clues to many of the images that follow.
