Lena Dunham has suffered a social media backlash after it emerged she has been commissioned by Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams to write the script for a film about a Syrian refugee who was stranded at sea. Dunham tweeted a report by Variety magazine that she was to work on an adaptation of A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea, the harrowing story of Doaa Al-Zamel, who survived the sinking of the boat on which she was attempting to cross the Mediterranean. (Her fiance drowned after their vessel was rammed.) The book was written by Melissa Fleming, head of communications of the United Nations’ Refugee Agency. Very lucky to have this job, to tell this story, to support this truth with these people. ❤️ https://t.co/EgcRfKA0ks However, Dunham, who wrote and directed the award-winning 2010 feature film Tiny Furniture as well as creating the HBO TV series Girls, was immediately accused on social media of “whitewashing”. Among the blizzard of negative responses, one respondent wrote: “Lena, PLEASE DON’T DO THIS. This is not your story to tell. Let an actual Syrian tell it. PLEASE!!!!”, while another wrote: “A person with your platform needs to provide the opportunity for real refugees to tell their stories. Their voices need to be heard, not yours.” Dunham has been approached for comment. Spielberg and Abrams are due to act as producers on the project, with short-film specialist Arif Hussein as executive producer. No director has yet been announced.
