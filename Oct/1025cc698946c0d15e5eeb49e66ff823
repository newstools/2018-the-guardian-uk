The European Club Cup, which has just begun in Halkidiki, northern Greece, is Magnus Carlsen’s final warm-up before the Norwegian’s world title defence against America’s Fabiano Caruana starts in London on 9 November. It will be a much sterner test for Carlsen than he would have expected. His world No 1 ranking, held without a break since July 2011, will be at risk if he has any serious setbacks. The event’s seventh and final round is on Thursday 18 October and all the games can be viewed free and live daily (1pm start) on chess24.com. Caruana’s Olympiad victories against Vishy Anand and Boris Gelfand, published here in the last two weeks, advanced his rating to 2832 against Carlsen’s 2839. Any Carlsen draws in Greece will lose rating points; any defeat will put him on the brink of dropping to No 2. Could it happen? The world No 3, Shak Mamedyarov, who leads a Baku squad which is essentially the Azerbaijan national team, and world No 4, Ding Liren, who won individual and team golds at the Olympiad and is currently on an unbeaten run of 87 games, are both very ambitious. The pair were narrowly denied a crack at Carlsen’s crown when Caruana won the Berlin candidates in April. Ding, along with China’s No 2, Yu Yangyi, is a hired mercenary for the top-seeded Alkaloid Skopje team in Greece, while David Navara leads the Novy Bor Czechs and Peter Svidler the St Petersburg Russians. Both are top-20 GMs and their teams will most likely meet Oslo and Carlsen at some point. Carlsen missed Friday’s first round game, but is likely to play the remaining six. He will need 4-4.5 points to retain his rating, a point less and Caruana will be the new world No 1. Somewhat ominously a Norwegian ratings expert has noted that Carlsen has played below expectations in each of his last five team tournaments and lost a total of 45 rating points. So, although the Eurocup is likely to be a demonstration that Carlsen is in top form against more challenging opposition than Trent Alexander-Arnold, it could be a banana skin for the world champion. The Eurocup also has significant English interest. David Howell, who made a fine score at the Olympiad, plays for Oslo and will be top board for any game that Carlsen decides to miss. Five English clubs from the national 4NCL league – Wood Green, Blackthorne Russia, 3Cs Oldham, Grantham Sharks and White Rose – are competing, with Wood Green’s GM Jon Speelman the highest rated player. Blackthorne Russia had the plum English draw, paired with St Petersburg who were playing without Svidler but still fielded six 2500+ grandmasters. The English squad fought hard but were outclassed and crushed 6-0 after four hours play. On top board IM Richard Bates lost to Nikita Vitiugov, a bronze medallist in the Batumi Olympiad. The English quintet are all seeded between 30th and 45th in the field of 61 teams from 25 countries, so anything above a 50% score plus an individual win or two against a higher rated opponent, will count as a success. The three squads from Ireland and one from Wales will have a hard time, as all are among the five lowest rated teams in the tournament. Ding performed strongly at the Olympiad, and on rating performances since 1 January 2018 he is narrowly ahead of Carlsen. Here his Peruvian opponent got into trouble on the d file (18 Nxd4! was better) and chose the drastic remedy of a queen offer for which he eventually got two rooks. That looked survivable until Ding unleashed his central pawns by 25…e3! and 26…f4! and Cordova, demoralised, allowed the simple mating tactic 29…Bxh3+!
