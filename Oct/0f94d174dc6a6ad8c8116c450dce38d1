News that the Danish airline Primera Air has collapsed has left many passengers wondering whether they will be entitled to a refund and how they will get home. I’m due to fly with Primera Air, what should I do? Customers who have yet to fly have been advised not to travel to the airport as all Primera Air flights have been cancelled. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Stansted have advised customers to contact the airline directly, but according to a statement on its website, Primera Air can no longer be contacted by email or phone. Will I be able to get a refund? If you paid on a credit card and your flight cost more than £100, you might be able to claim a refund through section 75 of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. If you paid with a debit card, check with the provider, as some offer their own protection schemes. You can also check with your insurance company, but many insurers won’t pay out unless your policy specifically included travel company failure cover. If you booked your flight – or a holiday that included flights – through a travel company that holds an Atol (Air Travel Organiser’s Licence), you will be entitled to a refund. Will there be rescue flights? The CAA has said it will not be stepping in to bring home UK passengers stranded abroad because Primera Air is not covered by its Atol protection scheme. When the British company Monarch Airlines collapsed in October 2017, the CAA brought home 110,000 customers at no extra cost on specially chartered planes. What should I do if I have already travelled abroad? If you booked your flights directly with Primera Air, you will have to make your own arrangements to get home. The CAA advises customers to contact their travel insurer or travel agent for help.
