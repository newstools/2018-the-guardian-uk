Sony has released the full list of games for its forthcoming PlayStation Classic, a miniature version of the iconic 1997 games console announced last month. Several of the console’s most fondly remembered titles are present, including Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid, the original Resident Evil and Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssee, alongside more obscure selections such as Wild Arms, which only ever gained popularity in Japan. Notable absentees include Parappa the Rapper, a groundbreaking music game about a rapping dog, and gothic adventure Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.
