Drake has beaten a US chart record that stood for more than 50 years, becoming the artist with the most top 10 hits in a year. The Beatles set the record in 1964 when their 11 hits included the chart-topping Can’t Buy Me Love and A Hard Day’s Night – but Drake has now beaten them with 12 Top 10 hits in 2018. The latest is his guest spot on MIA by Puerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny, which is currently at No 5. The Canadian rapper’s tally includes three No 1’s – God’s Plan, Nice for What and In My Feelings – all of which also topped the UK chart. The other tracks are Nonstop, I’m Upset, Diplomatic Immunity, Emotionless, and Don’t Matter to Me (the latter featuring a posthumous Michael Jackson), plus three others as a featured artist: Lil Baby’s Yes Indeed, BlocBoy JB’s Look Alive, and Migos’ Walk It Talk It. It’s been a record-breaking chart year for Drake, who, at 29 weeks, has also became the artist to spend the most time at No 1 in a single year, beating previous record-holder Usher. MIA is his 32nd Top 10 hit, putting him behind only Madonna (38) and the Beatles (34) in the all-time list. He is currently touring the US, following the release of his fifth studio album Scorpion earlier this year.
