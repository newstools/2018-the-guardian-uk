Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk are expected to be fit for Liverpool’s visit to Huddersfield Town on Saturday despite missing recent internationals through injury. The influential duo completed full training sessions at Melwood on Wednesday and, barring any late setbacks, will be included in Jürgen Klopp’s plans against David Wagner’s winless side. Salah missed Egypt’s fixture with Swaziland on Tuesday having been substituted with a muscle problem against the same opponents last Friday, and Van Dijk was rested from the Netherlands’ friendly draw with Belgium in midweek. Van Dijk played and scored for Ronald Koeman’s side in their Nations League win against Germany but was omitted against Belgium as a precaution against a continuing rib problem. Sadio Mané, who sustained a thumb injury with Senegal, and James Milner, who hurt a hamstring against Manchester City before the international break, are both doubtful for the trip to Huddersfield. Naby Keïta, who injured a thigh playing for Guinea, is still being assessed and could be out for a fortnight.
