José Mourinho has said he will not gloat if Manchester United beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday because he has too much respect for his former club. When United lost 4-0 at Chelsea two years ago Antonio Conte celebrated particularly demonstratively, to Mourinho’s annoyance. Although United’s manager, who has twice been in charge at Chelsea, did not reference this, he said: “Would I celebrate like crazy if my team scored a goal at Stamford Bridge or my team claimed victory? I don’t think so. I think I would try to control myself and to respect the stadium and the supporters that were my supporters and stadium for many years. “To do that should [mean] I completely lost my emotional control, which is not easy. Apart from that it is another match for me. I want to do well for my team, players, the supporters – I am 100% Manchester United tomorrow; no more space than respect for the stadium and the fans.” Mourinho has been granted an extension to 6pm on Wednesday to respond to his Football Association charge of “using abusive and/or insulting and/or improper” language. The charge relates to comments he made after the stirring 3-2 win over Newcastle United at Old Trafford, his side having been 2-0 down. Mourinho believes the good feeling remains from that victory in United’s last match before the international break. “Even today we don’t have every player back, so it is a bit strange when you come from the international week, but I think the feelings of the last match remain, so the players are fine, are happy and focused.”
