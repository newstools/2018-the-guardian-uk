This year’s other royal wedding will be broadcast as part of a special edition of ITV’s This Morning, but the BBC has decided not to televise the marriage of Princess Eugenie and her fiance, Jack Brooksbank. While a peak audience of 18 million Britons tuned in for May’s nuptials between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, there was less demand from broadcasters for live coverage of the marriage of Prince Andrew’s daughter. The BBC apparently passed on the opportunity to screen the event, which will take place on 12 October in the chapel at Windsor Castle – the same venue used by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. A spokesperson for the broadcaster did not deny claims that it had turned down the chance to screen the wedding live, but said clips from the service would appear on news services on the day. The royal household has confirmed that the full event will be shown on ITV Daytime, with husband-and-wife team Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford hosting a special edition of This Morning from Windsor. The programme will start at the earlier time of 9.25am and the full service will be broadcast from 11am onwards. ITV will then return to This Morning and Holmes and Langsford will be live with “comments, discussion and reflection on the events of the morning”. Eugenie announced her engagement to Brooksbank this year. The couple met while skiing in 2010. He used to work at the Mahiki club in Mayfair, London, and is a brand ambassador for a tequila company. About 850 guests have been invited to the wedding, with thousands of members of the public invited to stand in the castle grounds. Last month the Mail on Sunday claimed that Prince Andrew, the Queen’s second son, had sought the BBC’s cooperation in screening the event but had been told “there isn’t enough support for the Yorks”.
