The most important power broker in southern Afghanistan has been shot dead just days before parliamentary elections, along with at least one other top official, leaving a gaping power vacuum in the Taliban’s birthplace. A bodyguard opened fire at a top level meeting in Kandahar province on Thursday, killing the head of police Abdul Raziq, and the province’s spy chief. The Kandahar governor Zalmai Wesa was also shot. His condition was unclear. Raziq was accused of serious human rights abuses, but he was also considered a bulwark against the insurgents in an area that has always been their heartland. He had been credited with security improvements in recent years. The deaths risk destabilising southern Afghanistan at a time of huge political uncertainty and a worrying deterioration in the security situation. Afghanistan’s Tolo television station reported that the attack had been carried out by a bodyguard for Wesa. There were other senior Afghan officials at the site of the attack, but it was not immediately clear if any had been injured. The top US general in Afghanistan, Scott Miller, was also at the meeting, but was not harmed, a spokesman for the US-led mission said. Two US citizens were wounded. “Provincial officials including the governor, the police chief and other officials were accompanying the foreign guests to the plane when the gunshots happened,” said Said Jan Khakrezwal, the head of the provincial council, according to Reuters. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility.
