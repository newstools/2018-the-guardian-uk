Make a spice paste: peel a large banana shallot and place in the bowl of a food processor together with 2 peeled cloves of garlic, 50 cashews, 1 small, hot, red chilli, 2 tsp of ground turmeric, 20g of peeled ginger, 10g of galangal and 2 stalks of lemongrass. Process to a coarse paste with 1 tbsp of rice vinegar and enough groundnut or vegetable oil to make a coarse paste. Keep the flavours fresh and bright – don’t cook the spice paste for more than a minute or two Bring a deep pan of water to the boil. Scrub 300g of carrots. Cook the carrots in the water, lightly salted, then remove and drain. Trim 350g of green beans and cook in the boiling water for 3 or 4 minutes then drain and toss with the carrots. Fry the spice paste in a wok or wide pan over a moderate heat for 2 minutes, moving it around the pan so it doesn’t scorch. Pour in 400ml of coconut milk, add 5 lime leaves, lightly crushed and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and let it simmer for 4 or 5 minutes. Chop a good handful of coriander and stir into the sauce. Check the seasoning, adding salt as necessary. Toss the vegetables in the sauce and let them heat briefly through, serving as soon as they are hot. Serves 2 with rice. Keep the flavours fresh and bright – don’t cook the spice paste for more than a minute or two, otherwise your sauce will turn brown. Cook the vegetables briefly then drain and refresh them in iced water before adding them to the sauce. Use tenderstem broccoli, shredded cabbage or kale instead of the green beans. Keep the carrots for their earthy sweetness, but add short lengths of peeled salsify if you wish. Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
