Beyoncé and Jay-Z have confirmed rumours that they will tour together this summer, detailing dates in the UK, Europe and North America. The married couple previously mounted the On the Run tour together in 2014, to promote their respective albums Beyoncé and Magna Carta Holy Grail. The couple’s latest album releases are 2016’s Lemonade and 2017’s 4:44. They are appearing together on DJ Khaled’s current single, Top Off. Next month, Beyoncé will headline California’s Coachella festival. She was initially due to headline in 2017, but withdrew on doctors’ orders after discovering that she was pregnant with twins. The couple have three children in all – Blue Ivy Carter, six, and the twins Rumi and Sir, born 13 June 2017 – and will celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary on 4 April. The On the Run II tour starts in the UK at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium on 6 June, before moving to Glasgow’s Hampden Park (9 June), Manchester’s Etihad Stadium (13 June) and the London Stadium (15 June). They will then head to Europe for 11 dates, before a run of 21 dates across north America, concluding on 2 October at Vancouver’s BC Place. A pre-sale begins on 14 March before tickets go on general sale on 23 March.
