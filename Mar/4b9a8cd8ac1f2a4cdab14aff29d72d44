Donald Trump is considering replacing the embattled veterans affairs secretary David Shulkin with Rick Perry, the energy secretary. A source familiar with the White House discussions told the Associated Press that Trump has floated the notion of the cabinet reshuffle as a way to right the ship at the VA, believing Shulkin has become a distraction to the department’s work. The source was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations. Shulkin has faced several investigations over his travel and leadership of the department, but until now has received praise from the president for his work to turn around the department. The news comes after Trump’s firing of Rex Tillerson. Trump hosted Perry at the White House for lunch Monday, but no formal job offer was made, the source said. Shulkin faces an insurgency from within the agency and new allegations that he had a member of his security detail go shopping with him at Home Depot and then cart the purchases into his house. A bruising internal report found ethics violations in connection with the secretary’s trip to Europe with his wife last summer. Shulkin also is bracing for an upcoming VA watchdog report, due for release by summer, that focuses in part on whether he used his 24-7 security detail for personal errands.
