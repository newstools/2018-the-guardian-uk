With five days of competition left to go, the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics has already set a new record for ticket sales, surpassing the total number sold at Sochi in 2014. Sales have now reached 320,531. Friday’s opening ceremony was attended by 21,000 people, while more than 100,000 had purchased tickets for the first three days of competition – with a turnout rate of 75%. Some 90% of tickets for all remaining sessions in the Pyeongchang Games have been sold. The International Paralympic Committee president, Andrew Parsons, said: “It is fantastic news that Pyeongchang 2018 has now sold a record number of tickets. After three days of competition, the response from the athletes and Koreans has been outstanding. Athletes are thriving on the energetic support from the crowds and are delivering some exceptional performances as a result.” The United States currently top the medal table, with six golds and 17 medals in total, followed by Ukraine, and the Neutral Paralympic Athletes team consisting of Russian Paralympians. Pyeongchang is the 12th edition of the Winter Paralympics. Ticket sales are now also almost double the 162,974 sold for the Torino 2006 edition, and exceed the 230,000 sold at Vancouver in 2010. Lee Hee-beom, president of the Pyongchang organising committee said: “The people of South Korea have embraced the passion of the Games and many are experiencing para sports for the very first time.” “The number of visitors from overseas has also been a joy to see – lots of flags and fancydress on show at the venues, creating a wonderful atmosphere. We have more days of action to enjoy and I would encourage everyone to come and share this special moment with us.”
