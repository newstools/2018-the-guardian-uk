The International Cricket Council has launched a wide-ranging review into player behaviour after “one of the worst periods in recent memory” for the game. In the wake of the ball-tampering scandal which has engulfed the Australia team, the chief executive, David Richardson, has revealed plans to look sledging and dissent amid growing concern over the conduct of players. In a statement headed “Enough is enough” published on the ICC’s website, www.icc-cricket.com, he said: “We have seen a number of incidents of poor player behaviour in recent weeks which has included ugly sledging, send-offs, dissent against umpires’ decisions, a walk-off and ball tampering. “This has been perhaps one of the worst periods in recent memory for consistently poor player behaviour and the global outcry in relation to the ball-tampering is a clear message to cricket: enough is enough. “That is why, with the full support of the ICC board, we will undertake a wide-ranging review into player behaviour, the spirit in which the game is played and the code of conduct. “The spirit of cricket is precious to our sport and so intrinsically linked with good behaviour – the turn of phrase, ‘that’s just not cricket’ is not an accident. We must protect that spirit.” The review will be conducted by the ICC’s cricket committee with the assistance of current and former players – Allan Border, Anil Kumble, Shaun Pollock and Courtney Walsh are among those likely to be involved – the MCC and match officials, and will consider the level of sanctions set out in the code of conduct.
