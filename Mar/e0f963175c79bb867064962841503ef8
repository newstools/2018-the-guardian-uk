In June 2014 I reported to my bank fraudulent use on my credit card, which, among other things, related to £2,000-worth of dental treatment and flights purchased with Ryanair and easyJet. This money was immediately refunded to my card and, to this date, my card remains in use without any problems. Since then, I have bought and used Ryanair flights without any issue. But I have recently tried to purchase a flight with easyJet and each time my card gets refunded automatically. It has now confirmed that I am effectively blacklisted due to the fraud four years ago, even though it had nothing to do with me. The only way I can fly with easyJet is if I pay in cash at the terminal. I am a law-abiding citizen with an impeccable credit history and am being punished for someone else’s offence. RD, Birmingham EasyJet says that since the fraudulent booking was made using your card contact details, all the booking details were marked as “high risk” to prevent future fraudulent activity. Given the prevalence of ID fraud you might hope that the airline had a more flexible policy to distinguish victims from fraudsters, especially since, as soon as the Observer intervened, it was able to reinstate your latest flight booking and to remove the ban against your name.
