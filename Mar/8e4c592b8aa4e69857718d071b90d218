The Catholic church in Ireland has called on its followers to vote against liberalising the country’s strict anti-abortion laws in a referendum in May, in its most forceful intervention yet in the debate. As the Irish parliament began to debate a referendum bill, the bishops called on Catholics to “work actively” to resist change. Under the terms of a bill agreed by the government on Thursday, voters will be asked in May whether they want to repeal the eighth amendment, which was inserted into the constitution in 1983 and gives unborn foetuses and pregnant women an equal right to life, effectively enshrining a ban on abortion. The government says that if the yes vote wins it will push legislation through parliament later this year to allow abortions to be carried out up to 12 weeks into pregnancy. The bishops said in a statement: “We believe that the deletion or amendment of this article can have no other effect than to expose unborn children to greater risk and that it would not bring about any benefit for the life or health of women in Ireland. “We encourage you, therefore, as members of the human family, to work actively towards keeping the right to life in the constitution, in the name of equality, fairness and compassion for all.” Currently, terminations are allowed only when the life of the mother is at risk, and the maximum penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is 14 years in prison. On the subject of women and girls who become pregnant through sexual violence, the bishops said: “A child conceived following rape is also a person. He or she has rights, including that most fundamental of all rights, the right to life … these children are innocent and they are entitled to the best support and care that we can provide.” Ireland’s health minister, Simon Harris, said on Friday that a yes vote in May would represent a “quantum leap from our position today, where we have one of the most restrictive regimes, similar to Saudi Arabia.”
