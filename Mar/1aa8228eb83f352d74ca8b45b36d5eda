Australian rugby sevens captain James Stannard has fractured his skull after being allegedly punched by a British man outside a kebab shop early Friday morning.The 35-year-old was allegedly struck by a man in an unprovoked attack after reportedly having a “nice conversation” with him at around 3.10am.Stannard had earlier attended a farewell dinner for departing coach Andy Friend, who along with teammates Lewis Holland and Ben O’Donnell chased down the 22-year-old Brit after he tried to flee.Squad members, team management and family members of the players were present at the dinner and throughout the night. The veteran playmaker remains in a stable condition in St Vincents Hospital, with his participation in next month’s Commonwealth Games in grave doubt. Police say Stannard was standing outside the kebab shop when he was punched in an alleged unprovoked assault, causing him to fall and strike his head on the pavement.Inspector Steve Egbers says the two men were “seemingly having a nice conversation” at the time.“When he (Stannard) fell to the ground he’s done some damage to the side of his head,” Insp Egbers told reporters in Maroubra.Insp Egbers said Stannard would remain in hospital for “a little while” under observation.“He’s progressing OK. He’s got a sore head. He’s conscious and talking,” the inspector said.The 2016 Olympian, who has indicated this will be his last season before retirement, had assumed the captaincy in the absence of injured star Lewis Holland. Rugby Australia says it’s unknown whether Stannard will recover in time for the 14 April kickoff of the Games sevens tournament at Robina but it appears highly unlikely. His withdrawal would further gut the side of playmakers as they look to improve on bronze in Glasgow four years ago.“It’s shocking news and he’s pretty lucky,” RA’s Chris Ford said. Stannard led Australia to a 36-12 Games warm-up win against New Zealand in Sydney on Thursday.The teams were due to play again Friday, but the game was cancelled on Thursday due to a raft of New Zealand injuries with the players then given the day off.The accused was interviewed at Maroubra police station and has been charged with assault occasioning bodily harm. Bailed on strict conditions, he is expected to appear at Waverley local court on 19 April.
