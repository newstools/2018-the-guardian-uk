Set the oven at 240C/gas mark 9. Fry 4 Cumberland or herby breakfast sausages in 3 tbsp of oil or lard until evenly golden brown. Make life easier for yourself by using a pan, about 22cm in diameter, that will later go in the oven. Remove the sausages from the pan and slice into thick pieces. Drain a 400g can of butterbeans, but donâ€™t rinse them. Make a batter by whisking together 2 eggs, 150ml of milk and 150ml of water, 125g of plain flour and a little salt and pepper. Set aside. Roughly chop 1 tbsp of thyme leaves. Put the sausage pan in the oven and leave until the fat is smoking hot, remove from the oven then tip in the sausages and return the pan to the oven for 10 minutes. Pour the batter over the beans and sausages. Scatter over the thyme and return to the oven and bake for a further 25 minutes or so until risen. Enough for 2 or 3. The heat of the fat is crucial. Make sure that it is hot to the point of smoking before you add the sausage and then, 10 minutes later, the batter. The intense heat helps the batter to rise. Not so much a twist, but a toad in the hole really does require some gravy. Peel and thinly slice 2 medium onions, and soften them with 3 tbsp of olive oil, add 2 tbsp of flour, cook for a few minutes then pour in 500ml of beef stock, then a glass of marsala or medium dry sherry. Simmer for 15-20 minutes on a low heat, then add a couple of pinches of sugar, plus salt and pepper, and serve alongside the batter pudding.
