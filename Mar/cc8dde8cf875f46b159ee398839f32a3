Kagiso Rabada’s fourth 10-wicket haul in only 28 Test matches propelled South Africa to a six-wicket victory over Australia in Port Elizabeth but the seamer will play no part in the final two Tests of the series after being banned by the ICC. The 22-year-old claimed six for 54 from 22 overs, including nine maidens, in a furious second-innings return that brought an end to Australia’s innings at 239. That left the home side chasing only 101 for victory, and AB de Villiers top-scored with 28 as they knocked off the target despite losing four wickets. But the fiery Rabada’s conduct throughout the second Test has earned him a ban for the final two matches. He was handed a level one charge for the send-off he gave David Warner in Australia’s second innings, screaming in the opener’s face after bowling him, though expletives were not heard. He had already incurred a level two charge for a shoulder bump on the Australia captain Steve Smith on day one. “He has received a fine of 50% of his match fee and three demerit points after a disciplinary hearing following his denial of the charge,” said the ICC in a statement. “This means Rabada has accumulated eight demerit points within a 24-month period automatically leading to a two match suspension.” Rabada ended the match with combined figures of 11 wickets for 150 runs, proving to be the clear difference between the sides. Australia started the fourth day on 180 for five, a lead of just 41 runs, and could only add 59 more runs amid a tail-end collapse. Rabada ripped through the remainder of Australia’s order to leave South Africa’s victory a formality. He was suspended on disciplinary grounds last year, when he reached four demerit points during South Africa’s tour of England. Dale Steyn took 86 Tests to reach his South Africa record of five 10-wicket hauls, with Allan Donald only mustering three in 72 matches.
