Syria’s regime has retaken two more towns in eastern Ghouta, a war monitor has said, pressing an offensive to capture the rebel enclave on the doorstep of Damascus. Government forces seized Kafr Batna and Sabqa in the south of the enclave, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, as thousands of civilians fled into regime-held territory. Russia-backed regime forces have retaken more than 80% of the last opposition bastion outside the capital since launching a blistering air and ground offensive on 18 February, the observatory said. The assault has split opposition-held areas into three shrinking pockets each held by different rebels. The southern pocket is held by the Faylaq al-Rahman rebel group, which the observatory said counts about 8,000 fighters in its ranks. After Saturday’s advance, the group controls just a handful of areas, the monitor said: Arbin – the largest – as well as Zamalka, Hazeh, Ain Tarma and parts of the Damascus neighbourhood of Jobar. The thousands of civilians streaming out of the enclave into regime-held areas on Saturday mostly came from this southern sector, it said. On Friday, the enclave’s main rebel groups – Faylaq al-Rahman, Jaish al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham – said they would be willing to hold direct UN-sponsored talks with Russia on a ceasefire. More than 1,400 civilians have been killed since the regime offensive began, the observatory says, while tens of thousands more have fled. Jaish al-Islam controls an area around the main town of Douma in the north of the enclave, while Ahrar al-Sham holds influence in the area of the town of Harasta to the west.
