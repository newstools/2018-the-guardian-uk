A second charity screening featuring new episodes of Peter Kay’s television show Car Share has been added after tickets to the first event sold out in minutes. The comedian had announced the screening on Thursday in his first Twitter post since cancelling his first live tour in eight years last December due to “unforeseen family circumstances”. Tickets for the event at the Blackpool Opera House on 7 April were sold out in minutes after they went on sale at 9am Saturday. Shortly afterwards, a post on Kay’s Twitter feed said: “Due to demand a further Car Share showing will take place on Friday 6th April.” The Ticketmaster website said the new date was added due to “overwhelming demand”. On Thursday, Kay said that the charity screening would raise money for the Lily Foundation, which helps children with mitochondrial disease, an incurable condition with symptoms including seizures and muscle weakness. The comic said that he had “first-hand experience” of the foundation, adding: “I’m proud to raise both awareness and much-needed funds to help with the inspiring work they provide to children and their families.” The second series of the BBC One show ended on an emotional cliffhanger last year as John (Kay) failed to reciprocate the advances of his car share colleague Kayleigh (Sian Gibson). When John refused to say how he felt, Kayleigh walked out of his vehicle. Kay admitted in November that fans had been angry about how the series had ended. The comedian, 44, later announced that a special finale to reveal what happens next for the pair and an entirely improvised episode, Car Share: Unscripted, will be broadcast on the BBC in May. He described Car Share: Unscripted as “half an hour of us basically making the script up and improvising,” adding: “It’s nothing to do with the story – just us having a laugh.” Car Share won two Bafta TV Awards in 2016 for best scripted comedy and best male performance in a comedy programme.
