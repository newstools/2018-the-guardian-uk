England’s dreams of a second successive grand slam were shattered at Stade des Alpes last night. The team, led again by Sarah Hunter, can still win the Six Nations title in Coventry on Friday night but France secured victory with a last-minute try by their outstanding full-back Jessy Tremouliere. The crowd of 17,434 in Grenoble was a record for the women’s Six Nations and England, who had scored 137 points in their previous three games, looked to be heading for a hard-fought win thanks to Katy Daley-McLean’s two successful conversions and a late penalty. But England were never able to cut loose, every attack met by a blue wall of a French defence. Tamara Taylor, the lock who was winning her 115th cap, was prominent in the early stages when England began to test their opponents’ defence. England spread the ball wide and Abigail Dow, with a nice change of pace, went over for the first try. England were reduced to 14 players when their centre Rachael Burford was shown a yellow card by Joy Neville for a shoulder charge on Tremouliere. Tremouliere broke a tackle from Charlotte Pearce, a temporary replacement for Dow, to score in the corner but her conversion attempt struck an upright. France, though, smelt blood. In the last minute of the first half England lost their own lineout and the fly-half Caroline Droin plunged over in the same corner. After the break England began to dominate. From a lineout their pack drove forwards and Amy Cokayne, in the middle of an unstoppable rolling maul, scored their second try. Tremouliere landed a penalty to bring her side to within a point. But Daley-McLean stretched England’s lead with a penalty nine minutes from the end. England looked like holding on but the third best team in the world were more than a match for the second best. With two minutes remaining France spread the ball wide and Tremouliere went over for the winning try.
