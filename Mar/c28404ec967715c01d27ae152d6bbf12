Formula One has hired the composer of several Fast and Furious movies to write a new theme tune for the motor racing organisation. Brian Tyler, an Emmy-nominated American has made music for Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World as well as the Fast and Furious franchise, and also wrote theme music for ESPN’s NFL shows. “What an honor to be chosen to compose the Formula 1 theme! This is a life long dream come true as I am a massive £formula1 fan. Thank you £F1!,” Tyler, who was a guest at last year’s U.S. Grand Prix, said on his Twitter feed. US-based Liberty Media took over the sport in January last year and has set about engaging a younger audience as well as developing a digital strategy. Formula One launched a television streaming product, F1 TV, last Tuesday. “Within the context of looking at ways to bring fans closer to Formula One, we are exploring all avenues to refresh the look and feel of the show,” said a Formula One spokesman. “Music is a key component of the emotion of sport and we are engaging with top international talent in order to develop a new signature tune for F1. This is a process in development and we will make a formal announcement at the right time.” F1 has had a longstanding association with the outro from the Fleetwood Mac song The Chain after it was adopted by the BBC for its coverage in the late 70s and has been used on and off by broadcasters in conjunction with races ever since.
