An Israeli security guard has died of wounds suffered in a stabbing attack carried out by a suspected Palestinian assailant in Jerusalem’s Old City on Sunday, a hospital spokeswoman said. The assailant was shot and killed by police at the scene. A spokesman for Israel’s ambulance service said the man was stabbed in the upper body and was rushed to hospital by ambulance in critical condition. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said he was in his 30s and worked as a private security guard. Israel’s security agency named the attacker as Abdel Rahman Bani Fadel, a 28-year-old Palestinian father of two from the village of Aqraba near the city of Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
