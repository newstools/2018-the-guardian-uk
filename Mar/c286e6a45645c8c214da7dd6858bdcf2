At least two people have died and three are in hospital after a helicopter carrying six people crashed in New York City’s East river. A Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said the Eurocopter AS350 went down just after 7pm on Sunday in the waterway just north of Roosevelt Island and was “reportedly inverted in the water”. Eric Phillips, a spokesman for mayor Bill de Blasio, confirmed the fatalities in a Twitter post and one person had been rescued. New York Police said three people were hospitalized. The US Coast Guard said six people were on the helicopter. The Coast Guard launched three boats to aid in the response, joining New York City emergency responders. The Coast Guard said, “Five people have been recovered by New York City Police Department and the New York City Fire Department divers and their conditions are currently unknown.” Police say a sixth person, the pilot, freed himself and was rescued by a passing tugboat. The passengers were recovered by police and fire department divers, who had to remove them from tight harnesses while they were upside down, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. The helicopter was being chartered for a photo shoot when it went down. A video posted on Twitter shows a red helicopter landing hard in the water and then tipping over as its rotors slap at the water. Witnesses told local media that the helicopter appeared to fill with water quickly. “Its’ cold water. It was sinking really fast,” Mary Lee, 66, told the New York Post. “By the time we got out here, we couldn’t see it. It was under water.” Witnesses described seeing at least one person emerge from the helicopter and wave his or her hands for help. The helicopter, a model used by tourist companies, went down near Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. No other information has been released.
