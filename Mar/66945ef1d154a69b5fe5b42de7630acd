Firefighters are tackling a blaze in one of Glasgow’s busiest shopping precincts. Emergency services were called to Sauchiehall Street in the city centre at about 8.20am on Thursday, where a “well-developed” fire was burning above an outlet of Holland and Barrett. Nearby streets, which can be seen filled with smoke, have been cordoned off to traffic and several buildings have been evacuated while firefighters deal with the blaze. Witnesses described flames billowing from a first-floor window. A spokesman for the Scottish fire and rescue service said: “We were alerted at 8.18am to reports of a well-developed fire which had taken hold within the roof space of a commercial premise.” “Operations control mobilised a number of fire engines to Sauchiehall Street, where firefighters are tackling the fire. Crews have safely evacuated the occupants of several nearby properties.” Firefighters have reportedly asked pedestrians to move upwind because of concerns about asbestos in the burning building.
