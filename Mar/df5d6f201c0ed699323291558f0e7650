The US singer and rapper Trey Songz has handed himself in to police to face charges of felony domestic violence. On 21 February, Andrea Buera filed a police report claiming that he hit her in the face while the pair were attending a party in the Hollywood Hills, claiming that the musician became upset when she started talking to another man. She sought hospital treatment for her alleged injuries, TMZ reports. Songz, born Tremaine Aldon Neverson, denied Buera’s claims on his Twitter account: “I am being lied on and falsely accused for someone’s personal gain.” For weeks my lawyers & Mgmt have asked me not to comment on this and I initially agreed but this morning I feel that my fam, the women that raised me, my friends & fans especially the youth need to hear from me. I am being lied on and falsely accused for someone’s personal gain His lawyer, Shawn Holley, is said to have accompanied him to the Los Angeles Police Department, where he was booked at 6am on 19 March and released shortly after 8am, having posted a $50,000 (£35,600) bond. On 13 March, Buera gave a news conference in which she claimed that she and Songz have known each other for three years. In her account of the incident, she claimed, “Trey began yelling at me, choking me, punching me and ultimately he knocked me to the ground. While I was on the ground he continued punching me and he did not stop until his security guard pulled him off of me.” Buera claimed that the alleged attack left her with a concussion, and that she continues to experience trauma as a result. In August 2017, Songz pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer causing injury following an incident after a performance in Detroit in December 2016. He was required to complete anger management classes and pay compensation. Songz’s most recent release, Tremaine the Album, was released in March 2017 and debuted at No 3 on the US Billboard 200.
