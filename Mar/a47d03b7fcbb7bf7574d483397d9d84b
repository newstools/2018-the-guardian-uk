Bayern Munich moved into the Champions League quarter-finals after beating Besiktas in Istanbul on Wednesday to complete an 8-1 aggregate victory against the Turkish side. It was a record 11th successive victory in the competition for their coach, Jupp Heynckes, who had led Bayern to the title in 2013 before retiring and returning this season. The Bundesliga champions went ahead through Thiago Alcântara in the 18th minute to kill off any lingering hopes of an improbable recovery by the hosts after Bayern had hammered them 5-0 in the first leg in Munich. However, the Spaniard was taken off with a suspected ankle problem a little later, having only recently returned from an injury break. Bayern, who could secure their sixth consecutive Bundesliga title at the weekend, went 2-0 up seconds after the second-half restart when Gokhan Gonul volleyed a Rafinha cross into his own net. Besiktas, who were missing their entire central defence, offered little resistance despite controlling possession. They did manage to pull a goal back through Vágner Love’s effort in the 58th minute which breathed some brief life into the hosts. But the Bayern substitute Sandro Wagner chested in a David Alaba cross with six minutes remaining to confirm Bayern’s victory.
