LG has dumped Australian cricketer David Warner following the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa with the electronics company on Wednesday saying its current deal with the opening batsman was in its final weeks. “In light of recent events, we have decided not to renew our partnership,” a spokeswoman said. “LG Australia will always look to work with ambassadors that share our core brand values and we take these relationships incredibly seriously to ensure we put our customers, employees and stakeholders first.” Warner, who signed with the company in late 2014, was so effusive in his praise for the company’s OLED TVs in advertisements, the commercials were quickly parodied by fans. “I love my OLED. It’s one of the things I look forward to when I come home,” Warner said in one advert. “I wish it was compact enough that I could put it in my suitcase and take it away.” Warner’s website states he is a brand ambassador of Gray-Nicolls, Asics, Channel Nine, Toyota and the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Sanitarium this week removed all material related to sacked Australian skipper Steve Smith from the website of its breakfast cereal Weet-Bix. The wholly owned subsidiary of the Seventh-day Adventist Church said it was awaiting the results of the investigation by Cricket Australia. Warner, along with Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft, will reportedly return to Australia on Thursday in the aftermath of the ball tampering scandal.
