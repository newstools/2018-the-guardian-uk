Shakshuka means “a mixture” in Tunisian Arabic. I was first introduced to shakshuka by some Israeli travellers I met in Australia many moons ago. This recipe is as good on a cold night as it is for breakfast. (Serves 4)For the shakshuka:2 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, finely chopped1 red pepper, chopped1 red chilli, finely chopped2 tsp smoked paprika1 tbsp hot pepper paste or 1 tbsp tomato puree500g tinned plum tomatoes1 tsp chilli flakesSalt and pepper8 eggs For the tahini sauce:100g tahini100ml ice-cold waterSalt, to taste To serve:2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Sweat the onions and garlic in the olive oil until softened and translucent. Add the red pepper and chilli and cook for five to seven minutes, until the red pepper softens. Add the paprika and hot pepper paste or tomato puree and cook for two minutes. Add the tinned tomatoes and chilli flakes, bring to a simmering point, cook for 20 minutes and season to taste. Transfer the sauce to a wide, oven-proof frying pan and bring the sauce back to a simmer. Make eight wells in the sauce, crack an egg into each well and cook for two minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven for five to seven minutes, until the egg white is set and the yolk remains runny. Meanwhile, put the tahini in a mixing bowl and gradually pour in the water, mixing with a whisk. It will start to thicken, but keep adding the water until a smooth, sauce-like consistency is achieved. Season to taste with salt. Remove the pan from the oven, sprinkle with the parsley and dot with the tahini sauce. Finish with drizzle of olive oil. Serve with sourdough toast or pitta.
