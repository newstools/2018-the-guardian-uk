Car F1-W09 Engine Mercedes Principal Toto Wolff Debut France 1954 GPs 168 Titles 4 2017 1st Ominously strong in testing, Mercedes have stuck with last year’s concept and focused on ironing out their weaknesses. Already relentlessly reliable, the drivers believe the car is a step forward and the team are now favourites to equal Ferrari’s record of five consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ titles. Once again the team to beat. Lewis Hamilton (GB, aged 33) No44 Debut Australia 2007 Wins 62 Poles 72 Titles 4 Last season 1st Odds 4-6 At the top of his game and now only improving when presented with a challenge. Hugely comfortable with the team, he is motivated and still hungry for a fifth title to equal Juan Manuel Fangio. It will take a vigorous assault to stop him. Valtteri Bottas (Fin, 28) No77 Debut Australia 2013 Wins 3 Poles 4 Best finish 3rd Last season 3rd Odds 10-1 Still has much to prove. The Finn opened last season strongly but was soundly beaten by Hamilton thereafter. Now must show his pace and ability across the season to keep the seat. Putting Hamilton under pressure would be a major step. Car SF71H Engine Ferrari Principal Maurizio Arrivabene Debut Monaco 1950 GPs 948 Titles 16 2017 2nd Have taken last year’s well-balanced car and adopted a new high-rake approach, which has still to prove itself. Have not moved on as far as Mercedes over the winter but retain strong balance through the corners. Potentially have much to come but may open slowly. Sebastian Vettel (Ger, 30) No5 Debut USA 2007 Wins 47 Poles 50 Titles 4 Last season 2nd Odds 4-1 A strong effort last season marred by costly moments of weakness. Still Ferrari’s No 1 driver but to challenge must be able to match Hamilton’s mental strength and flawless execution. Kimi Räikkönen (Fin, 38) No7 Debut Australia 2001 Wins 20 Poles 17 Titles 1 Last season 4th Odds 40-1 Wingman to Vettel. If Ferrari harbour any ambition for the constructors’ title (and Räikkönen’s retention suggests they do not) the Finn must be more consistent and less erratic. Car RB14 Engine Renault Principal Christian Horner Debut Australia 2005 GPs 244 Titles 4 2017 3rd Brought a far more competitive car to testing and can expect to hit the ground running this season. Remain hampered by the Renault engine but are potentially closer to Mercedes than Ferrari. Early wins and solid reliability are crucial to back up a strong driver line-up. Daniel Ricciardo (Aus, 28) No3 Debut GB 2011 Wins 5 Poles 1 Titles 0 Best finish 3rd Last season 5th Odds 9-1 Has struggled to get on top of the higher grip and downforce of the new cars and although he outscored Verstappen last season was not as impressive as the youngster. Consistent and aggressive, can be fearsome if he puts it together. Max Verstappen (Neth, 20) No33 Debut Australia 2015 Wins 3 Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best finish 5th Last season 6th Odds 11-2 Showed far greater maturity last season, especially dealing with some woeful unreliability and was mighty quick when he had the car under him. Fearless and unintimidated, a burgeoning and exceptional talent who will push to the limit against all comers. Car VJM10 Engine Mercedes Principal Vijay Mallya, Robert Fernley Debut Australia 2008 GPs 191 Titles 0 Best finish 4th 2017 4th May struggle to punch above their weight as they have for the previous two seasons in a tense midfield. Currently focused on developing a strong mechanical platform for this year’s car. Upgrades arrive in Melbourne and subsequent deployment will dictate their real competitive level. Sergio Pérez (Mex, 28) No11 Debut Australia 2011 Wins 0 Best finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 7th Odds 250-1 Has been crucial to his team’s recent success but faces real a battle with Ocon this year as both have a point to prove. Still harbours ambitions of another shot with a top team and putting his highly rated team-mate in the shade is the best way to do it. Esteban Ocon (Fr, 21) No31 Debut Belgium 2016 Wins 0 Best finish 5th Poles 0 Best qualifying 3rd Titles 0 Best finish 8th Last season 8th Odds 250-1 Now settled at Force India, the young Mercedes driver will expect to prove his worth and potential to replace Bottas at the senior team by roundly beating Pérez. If he stays out of trouble he should have the edge over his team-mate. Car FW41 Engine Mercedes Principal Frank Williams Debut Spain 1977 GPs 666 Titles 9 2017 5th Adopted the most revolutionary approach on the grid with Paddy Lowe’s new design a drastic change from last year. Their ambitious plan has potential but it may take time to realise, especially given the inexperienced driver line-up. Lance Stroll (Can, 19) No18 Debut Australia 2017 Best finish 3rd Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best finish 12th Last season 12th Odds 750-1 A solid rookie season was a riposte to some of the opprobrium he received for earning his place with his father’s dollars but now he knows the cars and tracks he has nowhere to hide. Sergey Sirotkin (Rus, 22) No35 Debut season Odds 500-1 Russian rookie also bringing cash to the seat but has impressed and now has a chance to prove himself. Technically adept, he has a degree in race car engineering. Beating Stroll and bringing on the new Williams would make a major impression. Car RS18 Engine Renault Team principals Jerome Stoll, Cyril Abiteboul Debut GB 1977 GPs 341 Titles 2 2017 6th Now fully enjoying the resources a works team requires. Various new concepts on this year’s car will provide a challenge to bring it up to speed. Have focused on reliability first for the engine, with more power expected later. The second half of the season may indicate just how far the team has come and how far they are from the top three. Nico Hülkenberg (Ger, 30) No27 Debut Bahrain 2010 Wins 0 Best finish 4th Poles 1 Titles 0 Best finish 9th Last season 10th Odds 100-1 In his seventh season has perhaps the best chance yet to score his first podium and must perform strongly to reach the expectations of his ambitious team. The German enjoyed the grip of the new cars last year and now has a chance to exploit it and cement a long-term future with Renault. Carlos Sainz Jr (Sp, 23) No55 Debut Australia 2015 Wins 0 Best finish 4th Poles 0 Best qualifying 5th Titles 0 Best finish 9th Last season 9th Odds 125-1 Also eager to make his mark and Renault’s new car may prove to be just what the Spaniard wanted. He has shown flashes of great skill and undoubtedly has more to come. Car STR13 Engine Honda Principal Franz Tost Debut Bahrain 2006 GPs 226 Titles 0 Best finish 6th 2017 7th New partnership with Honda has got off to a good start. Put in huge number of laps in testing, with Honda beginning to deliver reliability. If they can turn up the performance the team may be in for their best finish yet. Pierre Gasly (Fr, 22) No10 Debut Malyasia 2017 Wins 0 Best finish 12th Poles 0 Best qualifying 14th Titles 0 Best finish 21st Last season 21st Odds 1000-1 Red Bull-backed and highly rated, the Frenchman has won GP2 and stood up well to being parachuted into Toro Rosso at the end of last season. Has great potential. Brendon Hartley (NZ, 28) No28 Debut USA 2017 Wins 0 Best finish 13th Poles 0 Best qualifying 17th Titles 0 Best finish 23rd Last season 23rd Odds 1000-1 Despite being in his first full season in F1, Hartley is hugely experienced at high-level racing. With Porsche he has won the World Endurance Championship twice and the Le Mans 24 last year. Gasly may have the edge in pace but the New Zealander could prove invaluable in developing the car. Car VF-18 Engine Ferrari Principal Guenther Steiner Debut Australia 2016 GPs 41 Titles 0 Best finish 8th 2017 8th Have the potential to threaten the bigger midfield teams, especially early in the season. Consistent and strong on single lap and long runs in testing, the car had pace and good balance. Could be the surprise package of the season. Romain Grosjean (Fr, 31) No8 Debut Europe 2009 Wins 0 Best finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 2nd Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 13th Odds 500-1 May benefit from confidence within the team that brake issues are behind them but as the senior driver he may also need to prove he can manage the anchors better by adjusting his style. Kevin Magnussen (Den, 25) No20 Debut Australia 2014 Wins 0 Best finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best finish 11th Last season 14th Odds 500-1 Another McLaren refugee looking to impress enough for a second shot at the top. Has settled well at Haas and could now assert himself over Grosjean and become the team leader. Car MCL33 Engine Renault Principal Eric Boullier Debut Monaco 1966 GPs 821 Titles 8 Highly optimistic of the new partnership with Renault but the team have much to do. The car looks good but was unreliable in testing with a range of issues. Under massive pressure, especially now the Honda money has gone, they must hope the worst is behind them and the upgrades for Melbourne will pay off. Failure will have major consequences. Fernando Alonso (Sp, 36) No14 Debut Australia 2001 Wins 32 Poles 22 Titles 2 Last season 15th Odds 25-1 Signed for another season on the basis that the team had a competitive engine but will not be pleased if compromised by reliability. Still wrestles more from a car than almost any other driver but wants a shot at podiums at least. Stoffel Vandoorne (Bel, 25) No2 Debut Bahrain 2016 Wins 0 Best finish 7th Poles 0 Best qualifying 7th Titles 0 Best finish 16th Last season 16th Odds 100-1 Escaped major scrutiny last year with the car so far off the pace but now has to impress. If he can match Alonso it would go far in answering critics. With Lando Norris being prepared to step up at McLaren, he needs to deliver. Car C37 Engine Ferrari Principal Frédéric Vasseur Debut South Africa 1993 GPs 441 Titles 0 Best 2nd as BMW 2017 10th Celebrated receiving this year’s Ferrari engine and the technical Alfa-branded relationship that goes with it with a raft of innovative aero ideas. However, they have yet to show any great effect. The car appears to lack grip and pace but the team, in the process of rebuilding, are optimistic they can unlock its potential. Marcus Ericsson (Swe, 27) No9 Debut Australia 2014 Wins 0 Best finish 8th Poles 0 Best qualifying 9th Titles 0 Best finish 18th Last season 20th Odds 2000-1 Faces his toughest test in the challenge from new team-mate Leclerc and is likely to be overshadowed. Ericsson brings finance but little else. Charles Leclerc (Mon, 20) No16 Debut season Odds 1500-1 Talented Ferrari junior driver comes hot from dominating F2 last season but now faces a testing rookie season in an uncompetitive car. Tipped as a replacement for Räikkönen, he is eager to make his mark and should do so, beginning with beating Ericsson.
