A man shot himself in front of the White House on Saturday, the Secret Service said, adding that no other injuries were reported. Donald Trump was not in residence at the time of the incident. The president was in Florida, staying at his Mar-a-Lago property. He spent the morning at one of his golf courses in the state. The Secret Service said on Twitter personnel were “responding to reports of a person who allegedly suffered a self-inflicted gun shot wound along the north fence line of [the White House]”. The White House was placed on lockdown. Members of the press tweeted that they were sheltering in place in the briefing room. A subsequent message from the Secret Service said: “Medical Personnel are responding to the male victim.” The DC police department said its “natural death squad” was at the scene. In Florida, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters: “We’re aware of the incident. The president has been briefed.”
