If you’ve grown tired of banana bread, these versatile mini-bakes are another way to use up any overripe bananas you might have lying around. Dates and cherries are my go-to dried fruits here, but prunes and dried apricots would also work well; experiment with any fruits you prefer. Prep 10 minCooking 12 minMakes 12 2 very ripe medium bananas (about 200g)200g light muscovado sugar200g unsalted butter, softened2 medium eggs280g plain flour3 tsp baking powder4 tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp salt200g medjool dates, chopped into small pieces50g dried cherries Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas 7. Line a 12-hole muffin tray with paper cases. Mash the banana until smooth. Beat together the sugar and butter until pale and fluffy, then add the eggs, mashed banana and all the dry ingredients except the dried fruit. Stir until well combined. Stir in the dried fruit, then divide the mixture evenly between the 12 muffin cases. Bake for 10-12 minutes, by which point the muffins should be well risen and a skewer inserted into the middle should come out clean. • Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay
