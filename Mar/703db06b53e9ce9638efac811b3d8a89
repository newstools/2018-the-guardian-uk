Some really good gags about American Beauty and the Fast and Furious franchise are part of what’s enjoyable about this extremely likable generation-gap comedy from screenwriting brothers Jim and Brian Kehoe. It’s a script that’s been on the black list for a while under previous titles Cherries, and The Pact. Kay Cannon (writer of Pitch Perfect) makes her directing debut. Leslie Mann, Ike Barinholtz and former WWE wrestling star John Cena play Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter – overprotective single mom, super-competitive coach figure and louche slacker-boozehound. They get to know each other at the school gates when they realise that their tiny kids have become best friends. As the years go by, the trio drifts apart but suddenly reunite in a spirit of parenting crisis when their girls hit their teen years. To these grownups’ collective menopausal horror, Julie (Kathryn Newton), Kayla (Geraldine Viswanathan) and Sam (Gideon Adlon) have made a pact to lose their virginities on prom night. So as the stretch limo heads off with their loved ones on board, accompanied by the dates their parents loathe, the three notional adults spring into action on a desperate mission to stop their teenage children having sex. They will be what the title promises and to underline this, the poster has an outline picture of what might be called a “rooster”. It’s an entirely daft comedy, but its goofy rollercoaster energy and genial good humour keep it barrelling along, with many a bad-taste fiasco along the way as our middle-aged sex-obstructing adventurers experience quasi-teen nightmares of their own and come to terms with their imminent empty-nest sadness. Cena is especially poignant with his great big slab of a head and what a young person cruelly describes as a “cop haircut”, which looks like he had it done in the back of a squad car.
