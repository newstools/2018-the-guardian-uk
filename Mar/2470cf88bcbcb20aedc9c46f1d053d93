A bizarre new theme park that claims to be designed for “selfie tourism” in Indonesia is causing consternation over accusations that it unashamedly rips off famous international works of art. Located in the city of Bandung, West Java, the Rabbit Town theme park features a rabbit petting zoo and art installations that appear to be blatant replicas of famous works. One installation, called the Patrico Sticker Room, which features a white room covered in colourful dots, looks a lot like renowned Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama’s work Obliteration Room. Sahabat sejati bukanlah mereka yang memiliki banyak persamaan, tapi mereka yang memiliki pengertian terhadap setiap perbedaan. . .

Sunaryo, a celebrated artist and gallery owner in Bandung, first heard about Rabbit Town when it went viral on social media this week. “This is embarrassing because Bandung is known as a creative city but then you have someone making this,” he said. “For artists who work hard for their careers, to have their works taken like that is heartache.” Sunaryo said the inspiration behind the works was clear and their public and commercial display problematic. Rabbit Town, he suggested, should apologise and clarify the permissions status for the works. Amir Sidharta, an art researcher and auctioneer, said Rabbit Town was clearly catering to the art market. “I think Rabbit Town is the kind of place in which the owner is very responsive to what people are looking at in museums,” he said. “People are going to museums not for their knowledge enhancement but more for taking selfies.” People in Indonesia’s art world are understandably upset about Rabbit Town, he said, and not only because of copyright issues. The theme park “could have easily engaged many Indonesian artists, since we have many talented Indonesian artists that could have produced unique creations just for his place, and that would be much more interesting.” Rabbit Town was opened in January by Henry Husada, the chief executive and chairman of the Kagum Group, and is located on his two-hectare property, according to a report by the Indonesian news site Kompas.com. Husada’s interest in rabbits is thought to be derived from his Chinese zodiac sign. As well as taking selfies, Rabbit Town visitors can also feed doves and koi fish, see monkeys, pet rabbits and view Husada’s collection of rabbit sculptures.
