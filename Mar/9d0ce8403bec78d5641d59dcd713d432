Brazil defeated Germany 1-0 in Berlin to end the world champions’ 22-game unbeaten run and restore some lost pride following the humiliating mismatch between the sides in their previous meeting, when Germany crushed the hosts 7-1 in that freakish World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte in 2014. Gabriel Jesus’s first-half header settled the friendly and provided his side with a welcome confidence boost less than three months before the World Cup starts. Brazil did not concede during the international break as they also defeated Russia 3-0 in Moscow. Jesus made the breakthrough seven minutes before the interval when the goalkeeper, Kevin Trapp, flapped at his powerful but centrally positioned header and allowed the ball go in. Willian’s cross came in with pace and Jesus was only five metres from goal but the goalkeeper was in position to make the save. Jesus had missed a good chance minutes earlier when he left two Germany defenders sprawling on a counterattack and then fired over with only the goalkeeper to beat. Ilkay Gundogan had the home side’s best chance when he mishit the ball after Julian Draxler pulled it back. The referee, Jonas Eriksson, asked the Brazil captain, Dani Alves, to calm his players down after Toni Kroos felt the effect of yet another robust challenge. Brazil emerged with more intent after the break, with Antonio Rüdiger blocking Willian and Paulinho drawing a good save from Trapp off the rebound, before Philippe Coutinho fired just over. Joshua Kimmich produced a vital interception to deny Coutinho, and Jesus missed an open goal from the resultant corner. At the other end Sandro Wagner twice headed good chances wide but that was as close as Germany got as Brazil adopted a 6-3-1 formation to protect their lead.
