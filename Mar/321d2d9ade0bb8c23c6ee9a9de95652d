It may have taken 132 years to get to a beach in Western Australia, but when the world’s oldest message in a bottle was discovered, it’s contents were slightly disappointing. The note, enclosed in a gin bottle which dates back to 12 June 1886, is believed to have been thrown from the German sailing ship Paula as it crossed the Indian Ocean. However, rather than a dramatic plea for help or a farewell to loved ones from doomed sailors, the message related to a worthy but not very exciting experiment to track ocean currents. Predictably, Twitter users had fun with some alternative options. "Please add me to your LinkedIn network" https://t.co/Rr37b3ZpJX One user imagined the bottle contained the plea to “send nudes”, while a commenter on Facebook suggested - considering the era in which it was penned - that it might in fact have read: “please, dispatch scantily clad sketches of your figure”. BREAKING! World’s oldest message in a bottle contained message ‘SEND NUDES’ pic.twitter.com/lIv2wmovY7 I bet it said #WengerOUT And it read, “Don’t vote for Trump” Was it from Sting? But not everyone was poking fun. Australians, used to a slow internet and postal service, took the opportunity to praise the speed in which the bottle travelled. 132 years to send a message, still better than my NBN Still quicker than Aussie post The bottle will be on display at the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Perth for the next two years.
