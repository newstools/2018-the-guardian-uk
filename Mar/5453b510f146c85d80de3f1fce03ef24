Pep Guardiola has accepted a Football Association charge of “wearing a political message”, though Manchester City have pointed out what the club believe are inconsistencies in the governing body’s position. City submitted the manager’s official response on Saturday in which the FA was informed Guardiola is content to “recognise the stipulations” of the rules of the association in which he is working and will observe these by no longer wearing the yellow ribbon, which is a show of support for imprisoned Catalan politicians. Yet City also stated to the FA that its stance on the ribbon appears out of step with Uefa, European football’s governing body. Guardiola is allowed to wear the ribbon for Champions League matches – the rule relates to what is worn on the person on the touchline during the 90 minutes of play. The charge related to City’s FA Cup defeat at Wigan Athletic on 19 February. Guardiola’s deposition pointed to how he had the ribbon covered in the two following games against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Premier League, and how it was also not visible for the defeat of Chelsea on Sunday. It did become visible during the Wembley showpiece, though it is understood this was inadvertent as it was initially covered. Against Wigan the ribbon had also been hidden by the manager’s jacket during the first half, with it becoming visible after the interval when Guardiola unzipped the top of his jacket. The FA said: “A paper hearing has been requested, with a date to be set in due course.”
