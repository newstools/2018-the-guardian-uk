Theresa May has joked that she called a snap general election last year only to avoid getting out of a speech to journalists, and that she might do the same again this Easter. During a speech at the Westminster correspondents dinner on Wednesday, the prime minister said of last year’s gathering: “I was looking forward to this event so much that I called a general election to get out of it. “But I can’t pull that stunt two years in a row. Or can I? I am, after all, going walking in Wales at Easter.” May famously called her botched snap election after a walking holiday in spring 2017. The prime minister, who has been under fire for a lack of control over her cabinet, spent much of the speech mocking her ministers. While acknowledging her own “Maybot” moniker, awarded to her by Guardian sketch writer John Crace for her wooden style of answering questions, she joked that if Boris Johnson was a smartphone app it would carry the warning “contains adult content”. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, was “like a drier, less frivolous version of LinkedIn”, and the Brexit secretary was described as David “Mad Max” Davis. The only cabinet minister who does have his own app also came under fire, with May describing her worry about Matt Hancock’s need to “track your location, access your photos” and the error message “there is a fault with Matt Hancock”. She joked about her predecessor David Cameron being “snowed into his wheely shed” and recounted his worries about “ambitious female home secretaries” taking his jobs, as she nodded to Amber Rudd. She also departed from the quips to praise Westminster journalists for electing two female chairs of its institutions – the parliamentary lobby and press gallery – for the first time.
