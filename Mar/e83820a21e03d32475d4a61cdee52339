Israel has arrested an employee of France’s consulate in Jerusalem on suspicion of smuggling weapons to Palestinians, officials have said. In a Hebrew-language statement, the Shin Bet security service said a French citizen had used a consulate vehicle to elude Israeli security checks and move 70 pistols and two assault rifles through the Erez crossing on the Israel-Gaza border to the occupied West Bank on at least five occasions. The French national, a man in his twenties, is due to appear in court in southern Israel on Monday, officials said. The man was arrested as he crossed the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip, which is governed by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, considered to be a terrorist organisation by Israel. He held several roles for the French consulate, including that of driver, carrying out regular trips between Jerusalem and Gaza. “We take this case very seriously and are in close contact with the Israeli authorities,” said a spokesman for the French embassy in Tel Aviv. “He has benefited and continues to enjoy the consular protection” provided to French nationals, said the spokesman without providing more details on the case. The Israeli foreign ministry, justice ministry, intelligence agency and police declined to comment.
