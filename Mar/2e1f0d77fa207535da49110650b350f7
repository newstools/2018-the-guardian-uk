Sir Elton John stormed off stage after a fan – one of a number who had been invited to join him round the piano – tried to touch him as he performed. The singer had invited a group from the audience on to the stage at his Las Vegas residency show while performing Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting. In a video clip circulated online, John is seen becoming irritated as one of the fans near his piano repeatedly leans over and tries to touch him and the keyboard. John, 70, appears to shout an expletive at the fan before getting up from his seat and walking off the stage. After the song finished, and the members of the audience had returned to their seats, John came back on stage. Before performing his next song, Circle Of Life, he told the audience: “No more coming on stage during Saturday Night, you fucked it up.” It is believed the person who tried to touch the singer was swiftly escorted from the venue. A representative for John has been contacted for comment.
