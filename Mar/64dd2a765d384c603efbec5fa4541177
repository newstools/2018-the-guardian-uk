Aylesbury’s David Bowie statue has been vandalised less than 48 hours after it was unveiled on 25 March. The words “Feed the homeless first” have been spray-painted on the ground in front of the statue, while “RIP DB” has been painted on the wall behind the statue. The work was funded through grants and a £100,000 crowdfunding campaign led by music promoter David Stopps. “It is a public piece of art and we will keep looking after it on a daily basis,” he told the BBC. “There is a webcam on it 24/7, so whoever did it, we have got them on webcam.” Steve Hogarth, lead singer of British rock band Marillion, unveiled the statue on 25 March. “It’s with a heavy heart and despair I hear that within 48 hours someone has defaced Andrew Sinclair’s breathtaking David Bowie double statue,” he said. “Such a shame. Hopefully it can be cleaned up … [And] hopefully this fabulous work of art will give people a reason to come to Aylesbury for many years to come. It’s worth the trip.” “Taxpayers will now be paying for the cleanup, so it is the vandal who will ironically be taking money away from the homeless,” local resident Helen Light told the BBC. The graffiti appeared overnight on 26 March; the cleanup had begun by the following morning. Bowie gave his first performance as Ziggy Stardust at the club Friars Aylesbury in July 1972. The sculpture features several of Bowie’s musical personas, with his Stardust incarnation at the centre. Aylesbury MP David Lidington is chair of the government’s anti-homelessness taskforce, which has been criticised for inactivity, meeting for the first time in four months on 7 March. In January on The Andrew Marr Show, he said the government had “set aside a very large sum of taxpayers’ money” to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and eradicate it by 2027. Rough sleeping rose in the UK for the seventh year running in 2017, up 15% on the previous year. Charities say even this steep rise fails to capture the true level of street homelessness. • This article was amended on 27 March to correct the crowdfunding total from £10,000 to £100,000.
