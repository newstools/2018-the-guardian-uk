A game in miserable conditions is never straightforward, but Chelsea made their FA Cup quarter-final easy in the circumstances, dispatching Liverpool 3-0 at Valerie Park. They do not, though, know who will join them in the last four as the three other ties – Arsenal v Charlton, Durham v Everton and Sunderland v Manchester City – were all snowed off. Chelsea’s first goal was scored by Jonna Andersson. The Swedish wing-back only joined the London club at the end of December but has made a fine start, and with 21 minutes gone applied a deft finish to Drew Spence’s low cross at the end of a sweeping move orchestrated by Ramona Bachmann. The away team extended their lead in the final minute of the first half, Katie Chapman powering a header over Siobhan Chamberlain after being left unmarked from Magda Eriksson’s free-kick. The error was repeated a few seconds later when Chapman was again first to an Eriksson free-kick – but this time her thumping effort was saved. Chelsea did not let up in the second half, with Drew Spence and Erin Cuthbert both coming close before Gemma Davison battled down the right and into the box, whereupon Alex Greenwood upended her. Maren Mjelde took the resultant penalty, sending Chamberlain the wrong way, and with 58 minutes gone, the tie was effectively over. Though Chelsea remained in control, they appeared to ease up with Wednesday night in mind: they play Montpellier in the Champions League quarter-finals.
