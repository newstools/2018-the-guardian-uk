England’s women finished runners-up in the SheBelieves Cup after a Karen Bardsley own goal gave the USA the victory that secured them the title. The Lionesses were hoping to pick up one point from the match in Orlando to claim the title, but after confusion in defence in the 58th minute, an attempted clearance by Millie Bright hit the keeper Bardsley to give USA a 1-0 lead. England continued to pile on the pressure and an equaliser nearly arrived late in the game as Ellen White’s header bounced off the inside of the post. Phil Neville, in his third match in charge of the women’s team, looked happy with the 0-0 scoreline at half-time. It would have been enough to see his side lift the trophy on goal difference, after a 4-1 win over France followed by a 2-2 draw with Germany. But the testing moments at the end of the first 45 minutes – a powerful strike from Mallory Pugh falling just wide of the post – continued in the second half. Neville brought on Toni Duggan and Nikita Parris who both created chances, while the last-gasp effort came in the 87th minute when Lucy Bronze’s free-kick found Izzy Christiansen who crossed for White. The Birmingham City striker was left in disbelief as her header hit the post and bounced to Tierna Davidson who cleared the ball from the line. It meant the USA finished top of the table while England were second, ahead of the defending champions France on goal difference. Germany finished bottom. Before the match at Orlando City Stadium, there had been a moving moment of silence for the 17 victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The team invited the family of victim Alyssa Alhadeff, as well as her club and school teams. The guests all received special jerseys with Alhadeff’s name and number on them.
