Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan has announced that he is suffering from what he describes as a “rare disease”. The veteran star wrote on Twitter that he didn’t want fans to speculate about his condition until he had a “conclusive diagnosis”. He said that he would reveal more about the illness within a week to 10 days. “Sometimes you wake up with a jolt, with life shaking you up,” Khan wrote. “The last 15 days, my life has been a suspense story. Little had I known that my search for rare stories would make me find a rare disease. “My family and friends are with me and we are working it out in the best way possible. In trying times, please don’t speculate as I will myself share with you my story within a week – 10 days, when further investigations come with a conclusive diagnosis. Till then, wish the best for me!” 🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/JXD8NKwH3D Khan made his screen debut in the Academy Award-nominated 1988 drama Salaam Bombay! and has gone on to appear in more than 100 films.
