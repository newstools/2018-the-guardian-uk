The acclaimed British artist Tracey Emin has perched almost 70 life-size bronze birds on lamp-posts, awnings and window sills along a busy pedestrian thoroughfare in Sydney’s business district. She hopes the permanent public artwork, commissioned by the City of Sydney, will slow life down for just a moment for those who notice the small sculptures. “The city is massive but the birds are small, tiny, delicate, fragile, like we are as human beings,” she said in a video promoting the work, which will be officially unveiled next Wednesday. Emin says she has been drawing birds, which she considers “angels of this Earth” for 25 years. The trail of birds will stretch down Grosvenor Street and Bridge Street, culminating at a large stone bird bath in Macquarie Place park, inscribed with the name of the artwork The Distance of Your Heart. Emin was among 700 artists who pitched for the city’s public art initiative. Her work, which cost $912,000, was made from two tonnes of bronze and took four years to complete. “I’ve done big shows, I’ve done this and I’ve done that; Venice [Biennale], I’ve represented Britain,” she told Fairfax Media. “All these things are not as big as this because this is not about me and not for some collector who bought it or some museum who thought it was good.” Earlier this week, the internationally renowned Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei unveiled his huge artwork, Law of the Journey, on Cockatoo Island, as part this year’s Biennale of Sydney exhibition. The artwork is a 60-metre-long rubber boat crammed with refugees.
