The rapid spread of fire through the upper floors of a hotel and apartment block building in Dublin poses “serious questions”, a local politician has said. More than 60 firefighters from eight crews were needed to battle the major blaze at the complex in Ballymun near Dublin airport on Wednesday night. The Metro hotel building comprises hotel rooms on the lower floors and residential apartments on the upper floors. Dublin fire brigade said crews remained at the scene into Thursday morning to ensure the fire was completely extinguished. There were no reports of injuries or missing people from the building, which is sometimes used to accommodate families in need of housing. Local Fianna Fáil councillor Paul McAuliffe said the blaze was “one of the most significant fires in the Dublin area in recent times”. “Its cause and the spread of it in such a rapid way are going to have to be investigated. Dublin fire brigade have that capacity to investigate these fires. We want to see the results of it and I imagine there will be serious questions asked.” One witness, Anthony Flynn, a co-founder of the Inner City Helping Homeless organisation, said the fire seemed to spread “like mad” in scenes reminiscent of the Grenfell Tower fire in London. Erica Fleming, whose apartment overlooks the hotel, said she could see and hear windows exploding as a result of the heat. Ireland’s housing minister Eoghan Murphy said he was monitoring the situation. Dublin West TD Roisin Shortall praised the fire services for their “excellent and brave work”.
