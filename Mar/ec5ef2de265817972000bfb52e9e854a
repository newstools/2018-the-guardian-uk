ParalympicsGB won their first medal at Pyeongchang 2018 as Millie Knight secured silver in the visually impaired women’s downhill category. Alongside guide Brett Wild, Knight finished 0.86 seconds behind the victorious Slovakian Henrieta Farkasova and her guide Natalia Subrtova. Knight had crashed and suffered a concussion on the same course in the 2017 World Championships but she showed no fear in her medal-winning run 1min30.58sec. “I literally can’t stop smiling,” Knight said afterwards. “This is amazing, the year we have had to get here, it has been a struggle. I never really thought we’d be back in this position. “It is the best feeling in the world. I knew I’d stopped at the finish line and that was my goal, there was no repeats of last year where I just landed on my face.” Russians Ekaterina Rumyantseva and Mikhalina Lysova collected the first gold medals for the Neutral Paralympic Athlete delegation by coming first in two biathlon categories. Rumyantseva finished first in the 6km standing up race, while Lysova claimed top spot in the visually impaired competition. Former soldier Scott Meenagh became the first Briton to compete in the Nordic skiing events in 20 years, following in the tracks of Terry Ahrens who took part in the Nagano 1998 Games. The double amputee finished 18th in the 7.5km seated biathlon. “It feels amazing, absolutely incredible,” Meenagh explained. “Racing out there was such a buzz today, there was a different energy. It’s so different at a Paralympics and to be there with some of the best people in the world was an absolute privilege and it brought another level out of me today.” The United States can already boast three gold medals, as Daniel Cnossen won the event in which Meenagh competed. Kendall Gretsch was also a biathlon goal medallist as she won the women’s sitting category. Andrew Kurka, who works as a country music DJ, was fastest in the men’s sitting downhill event.
