Peel 750g of swede then cut it into large chunks. Place the swede in a steamer basket over a pan of boiling water, then cook it for about 30 minutes until soft. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Meanwhile, trim 2 medium-sized leeks, slice them and rinse thoroughly in cold running water. Melt 60g of butter in a pan, add the leeks and let them cook for 20 minutes or so until they are totally tender. When the swede is soft, crush it with a fork, vegetable masher or wooden spoon, and season generously with salt and black pepper. Fold the cooked leeks and the butter they have been cooked in into the mashed swede, then spoon them into an ovenproof dish. Bake the leeks for about 35-40 minutes, until the top is lightly crisp. Serves 2. Swede can be a bit wet when boiled, so I suggest steaming it. That way the vegetables will producer a drier, less watery mash. Parsnip will work here in place of the swede, although the effect will be slightly sweeter. I am also tempted to introduce some crumbled sausage meat, fried until almost crisp in a shallow pan or, better still, a bit of black pudding.
