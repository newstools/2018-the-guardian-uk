Jaap Stam has left his position as Reading manager after a run of one win in 18 league games, the Championship club have announced. The 45-year-old took Reading to the 2017 Championship play-off final in his first season in charge, but leaves with the club just three points above the relegation zone. A statement on the club’s official website read: “Reading Football Club announce that Jaap Stam has left his position as manager of the club with immediate effect. “Majority shareholders, Mr Yongge Dai and Ms Xiu Li Dai, had wanted to give Jaap every opportunity to turn around what has been a difficult and challenging Championship campaign. “Jaap has not wavered in the time, effort and sheer determination he has put in to try to steer the team away from the position we find ourselves in. However, after careful consideration, the decision has been made that a change is now necessary.”The former Manchester United and Lazio centre-back, who earned 67 caps for the Netherlands, was appointed in the summer of 2016 after working as an assistant coach at Ajax. In his first season as a manager, Stam led Reading to a third-place finish, but saw his side lose to Huddersfield Town on penalties in the play-off final. This season, Stam has overseen just eight wins in 38 games. “We would like to thank Jaap for his hard work and commitment, in particular noting what he achieved in a memorable first season in club management, and we wish him the very best of luck in his future endeavours,” the statement added. “We will now focus on identifying and recruiting the right person to take Reading forward.”
