Treble-chasing Bayern Munich demolished hapless Borussia Dortmund 6-0 thanks to a Robert Lewandowski hat-trick but they will have to wait until next weekend to clinch the Bundesliga title. Schalke had prevented Bayern Munich from sealing the title when earlier in the day they beat Freiburg 2-0 thanks to goals from Daniel Caligiuri and Guido Burgstaller. In a whirlwind first-half performance Lewandowski scored twice, while James Rodríguez, Thomas Müller and Franck Ribéry were also on target for Bayern, who are away to Sevilla in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday. Lewandowski confirmed his fine form with his third goal of the match in the 88th minute to end a one-sided game. Bayern moved on to 69 points, 17 ahead of second-placed Schalke with six matches remaining. Dortmund, who lost for the first time in the league under Peter Stöger, remain third on 48. RB Leipzig worked their way back into Champions League contention with a nervous 3-2 victory at Hannover that lifted them to 46 points and fourth place, a point ahead of Bayer Leverkusen, who managed only a goalless draw against Augsburg. Emil Forsberg, Willi Orban and Yussuf Poulsen were all on target for Leipzig. Hamburg, who were bidding for a first league victory since November, could only manage a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart. Hamburg’s record of having never been relegated from the Bundesliga looks under serious threat this year, though they led at Stuttgart through former Tottenham midfielder Lewis Holtby. A fifth league win of the season eluded them as Daniel Ginczek equalised on the stroke of half-time. Serge Gnabry and Mark Uth both scored two goals as Hoffenheim thrashed Cologne 6-0.
