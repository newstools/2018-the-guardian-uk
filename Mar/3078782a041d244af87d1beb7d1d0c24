The Philadelphia Eagles All-Pro defensive end Michael Bennett has surrendered to authorities in Houston on a charge that he injured a paraplegic woman as he tried to get onto the field after last year’s Super Bowl to celebrate with his brother. Bennett made a brief court appearance on Monday where the judge set his bond at $10,000 on a felony count of injury to the elderly. He was expected to post bail and be released and be allowed to travel between his off-season home in Hawaii and Houston for court appearances. Bennett was a spectator at the Super Bowl in Houston in February 2017 when he tried to get onto the field immediately afterward to see his brother, Martellus Bennett, who played for the New England Patriots at the time. Prosecutors allege he pushed through security personnel, including a 66-year-old woman in a wheelchair who was a stadium employee. The Eagles acquired Michael Bennett from the Seattle Seahawks in a trade this offseason. The Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said they learned of the incident on Friday but says he does not believes the Seahawks deliberately withheld information from the team. Roseman said he had discussed the matter with Bennett. “People are innocent until proven guilty,” Roseman said.
