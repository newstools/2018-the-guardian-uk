The University of Exeter is investigating claims of racism among its law society members, after messages shared online show “vile” racist comments made in a private students’ WhatsApp group. The university tweeted to say, “we unreservedly condemn any act of racism”, but said they would not comment further until their investigation concludes. The comments allegedly made in messages shared between members of The Brackton Law Society were revealed by a student who shared a screen-grab of a conversation on Facebook. The Brackton Law Society said it “has taken the decision to remove those involved from committee... and indefinitely ban all those involved from the Society”. It comes as in a separate incident two men were arrested after a black university student at Nottingham Trent University, Rufaro Chisango, complained that a group of people subjected her to racist abuse in her hall of residence. We want to hear from students about how widespread an issue this is. Have you experience racism in a society or group? Have you reported it and felt like you weren’t listened to?
