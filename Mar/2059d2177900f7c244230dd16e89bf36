The Australia head coach Darren Lehmann will remain in his job following the ball-tampering controversy in the third Test against South Africa, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has announced. Sutherland said captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were the only players aware of the ball-tampering plot and all have been reported for breaching Cricket Australia’s code of conduct, with decisions on sanctions for each player to be made in the next 24 hours. Sutherland said Tim Paine has been appointed captain of Australia’s Test team, and said the three players involved in the ball-tampering case will leave South Africa on Wednesday. Bancroft, Smith and Warner will all be sent home ahead of the fourth and final Test of the series, with wicketkeeper Tim Paine appointed as captain. Sutherland added: “No other players or support staff had prior knowledge and this includes Darren Lehmann, who despite inaccurate media reports has not resigned from his position. He will continue to coach the Australia men’s team under his current contract. “Once the investigation has concluded in the next 24 hours sanctions will be announced. All three players who have been reported will leave South Africa tomorrow. Tim Paine has been officially appointed captain of the Australian men’s Test team.” Lehmann never knew - 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥 “I want to apologise to all Australians for what took place,” Sutherland added. “It’s about the reputation and integrity of Australian cricket and Australian sport and whether Australians can take pride in their national team.” A statement on Cricket Australia’s website announced that Smith had been stripped of the captaincy for “at least the final Test in South Africa”, with Paine “endorsed by the board as his successor and Australia’s 46th Test captain”. Matthew Renshaw, Joe Burns and Glenn Maxwell have been called into the squad for the fourth Test to replace Smith, Warner and Bancroft. Asked whether he believed the ball-tampering to be an isolated incident, Sutherland said: “The feeling from Iain [Roy, Cricket Australia’s head of integrity] in his review is that it’s an isolated incident, but again there are things that I don’t want to go into too much detail around right now. I certainly hope it’s an isolated incident, but it’s certainly one of significant concern. “This is not in the laws of the game, it is not in the spirit of the game and I am angry and disappointed. It is not a good day for Australian cricket.” • Full report from Ali Martin and Adam Collins to follow …
