Jane Bown took this picture for the Observer’s Easter Sunday paper exactly 60 years ago. It shared the front page with a couple of stories. One reported on the unseasonable holiday weather, the 1958 equivalent of the “beast from the east”, with a forecast that included “snow, sleet, rain, ice, flooding and fog”. The other dwelt on the previous day’s Aldermaston peace marches. The Observer’s celebrated feature writer John Gale had evidently been dispatched in search of some “colour” and his report delivered: “There was a young girl among those carrying the large banner of the Twickenham branch of CND, (a painted group of father in dark suit and mother in blue, and small child in yellow in her arms) and she had very pink legs below her green jeans…” The girl in Jane Bown’s picture clearly had a different, no less ardent Easter mission in mind. Her eyes are fixed on the shop-window chocolate eggs, some as big as her head. When Jane took this picture she had been working for the paper for about five years. She became, justly, most famous for her portraits of the great and the good, but throughout her 60-year career on the paper’s staff, it was her studies of children that often gave her most pleasure. Jane’s childhood had been an unhappy one. Born “on the wrong side of the blanket”, given up by her mother and passed grudgingly between aunts, she had an unfailing eye for private infant moments of complicated longing. I talked to her at her home about that instinct, not long before she died, aged 89, in 2014. She said it was revealed to her the moment she picked up her first camera: “Somehow I was off and running,” she recalled. “Instead of learning about lights and so on, I could just see through that little square all sorts of things.”
