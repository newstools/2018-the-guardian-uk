At the Maison Margiela show, Pat McGrath painted models with bare, glossy faces, and super-matt fuchsia lips. When you looked closely, the lips revealed themselves to be two hearts, flipped on their sides. It’s a pop art moment and a statement look, but one that’s subtle enough that it shouldn’t be too scary for you to try it out this Friday night. 1.
