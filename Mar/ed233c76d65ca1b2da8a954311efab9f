Vanessa Trump, the wife of Donald Trump Jr, filed for divorce on Thursday, according to reports. Vanessa Trump filed for an uncontested proceeding, “meaning she’s not expecting a legal battle over custody of the couple’s five children or their assets”, the New York Post reported. On Wednesday the paper said the president’s eldest son and his wife of 13 years “were living separate lives” and that Trump Jr, 40, was “never there”. In a joint statement, the couple said they had decided to go their separate ways., adding they “will always have tremendous respect for each other” and their families. In January 2017, Trump Jr and his brother Eric took over the day-to-day management of the Trump Organization, the president’s business empire, after their father took office. Trump Jr has remained involved in politics. Trump Jr campaigned for Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania this week, as did his father. But Saccone lost the election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district to the Democrat Conor Lamb. Trump Jr’s political involvement has brought him under scrutiny from the special prosecutor Robert Mueller for his role in potential collusion between Russia and his father’s presidential campaign. In 2016, Trump Jr received an email offering compromising information on Hillary Clinton from someone claiming to represent the Russian government. “If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr replied. Trump Jr and Vanessa Trump married in November 2005. A wedding announcement from the time, posted in the New York Times, said the ceremony was held at Mar-a-Lago, Trump Sr’s membership club in Palm Beach, Florida. Donald Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry – then a judge in the United States court of appeals for the third circuit – officiated the marriage. The Associated Press contributed to this report
