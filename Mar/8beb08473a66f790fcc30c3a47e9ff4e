Dickens, Scott, Swift, Wordsworth, Darwin, Adam Smith, even Napoleon; all were just warm-up acts for Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, at the top of the bill in a books and manuscripts auction held at Bonhams in London on Wednesday. While offerings from the 18th- and 19th-century titans did well to top £5,000 (all figures sans premium) - a feat achieved by a Wordsworth manuscript that went for £11,000, but £1,000 to £2,000 for literary letters, manuscripts and first editions were more typical - the star lots from Plath and Hughes’ estates, put on sale by the poets’ daughter Frieda Hughes, were expected to go for several times that. And so they did: a proof of The Bell Jar, complete with her corrections, sold for £60,000; her own first edition of the novel, poignantly signed and dated “Christmas 1962”, a few weeks before her death, went for £70,000; and the typewriter on which she wrote it, a mint green Hermes 3000, for £26,000. This puts Plath’s typewriter comfortably above Jack Kerouac’s, also a green Hermes, which pulled in $22,500 (£16,000), and John Updike’s $4,375 (£3,110) - but below the £56,250 paid for Ian Fleming’s gold-plated Royal and the stunning $254,500 (£181,000) for Cormac McCarthy’s humdrum Olivetti. No less fascinating were the non-literary Plathinalia under the hammer: a wallet full of membership and ID cards from the late 1950s (£7,000), a tartan skirt (£1,700), three wristwatches (£4,000 together), and a dragon pendant (£8,000). Bonhams seem to have been pleasantly surprised by the amounts paid for scruffy books once owned by Plath. Plath’s beloved, yellowing copy of The Joy of Cooking, marked with asterisks for her favourite meals and plentiful annotations (“Ted likes this” sits next to a recipe for breaded veal slices), outperformed Dickens and company, with a winning bid of £3,500. Her equally aged Roget’s Thesaurus, boasting “over 1,000 underlinings”, mocked its £1,000-£2,000 estimate by attracting £11,000. Meanwhile, Hughes’s inscribed first editions of works such as Hawk in the Wind and Lupercal also mostly exceeded expectations, but a striking pen-and-ink portrait of him by Plath, thought to have been sketched on their honeymoon, was almost alone in faring disappointingly: though £15,000 was a spectacular price in the context of the auction as a whole, it was well below the £20,000-£30,000 estimate. Did the auctioneers simply miscalculate, you wonder, or are collectors and institutions still eager to have Hughes’s books in their vitrines, but less keen than before (in the wake of the abuse allegations that surfaced recently) to have his image on their walls?
