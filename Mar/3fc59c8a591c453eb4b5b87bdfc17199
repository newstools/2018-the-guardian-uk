Polls have opened in Sierra Leone’s runoff presidential election. Voting is peaceful and the turnout is lower than in the first round on 7 March. Security is tight in the west African nation. The vote had been set for Tuesday but was delayed after a ruling party member filed a court challenge alleging irregularities in the first round and a temporary injunction was issued, stalling preparations. It was lifted early this week and the election commission asked for a few more days to prepare. The opposition Sierra Leone People’s party, which took 43.3% to the ruling All Peoples Congress party’s 42.7% in the first round, has not held the presidency since 2007. President Ernest Bai Koroma has served two terms and is barred by the constitution from running again.
