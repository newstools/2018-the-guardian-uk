A 22-year-old British man has died after reportedly falling from a fifth floor balcony in Majorca while on holiday with friends. According to reports in the local newspaper Diario de Mallorca, police inquiries suggest the man lost his balance and fell through a void on the balcony at an apartment in Palma, the island’s capital. He was believed to have been discovered at 6am on Sunday by a member of the public. Emergency services attempted to resuscitate him for several minutes. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: “We are in touch with local police, and are providing bereavement advice to his family, following the death of a British man in Mallorca.”
