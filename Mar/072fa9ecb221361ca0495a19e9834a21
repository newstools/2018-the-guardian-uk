The NFL combine, in which college players show off their skills to scouts and coaches, is usually dominated by athletes who have been tipped for greatness for years. This year’s star is a little different. When Shaquem Griffin was a child, his left hand was amputated due to a pre-natal condition. He nevertheless grew up to star for his high school in track, football and baseball before winning an athletics scholarship to the University of Central Florida alongside his twin brother, Shaquill. Some believed UCF had offered Shaquem a place just to curry favor with Shaquill. If that was true the coaching staff were soon pleasantly surprised: the linebacker was named American Athletic Conference defensive player of the year in 2016. At this week’s combine, Shaquem was again expected to be a curiosity rather than a standout performer. But on Saturday he bench-pressed 225lbs 20 times, using a prosthetic hand. His previous best was 11 and his twin, who turned pro early with the Seattle Seahawks) had only managed 17 last year . “Everybody in the stands was hyping me up,” Griffin said. “ I got the guys I’m here with hyping me up. It felt amazing.” .@Shaquemgriffin vs. @DJChark82 vs. @CalvinRidley1 vs. @saquonb21 in the 40-yard dash SIMULCAM! 🔥🔥🔥#NFLCombine📺: @nflnetwork pic.twitter.com/FLzfvZdRUL On Sunday, Griffin was even better in the 40-yard dash, an important event in a league where speed is a coveted skill. His time of 4.38 seconds was the fastest ever by a linebacker – 4.65 is considered outstanding – and the exact same time as his brother, a cornerback, managed last year. Shaquem’s time was also faster than the combine’s top-rated wide receiver, Calvin Ridley and running back Saquon Barkley, who is considered a future star. “This is a legitimate football player,” NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock said. “He’s an energy giver.” The simulcam you've been waiting for.@ShaquemGriffin vs. his twin brother @ShaquillG in the 40! #NFLCombine📺: @nflnetwork pic.twitter.com/GNhJqQ0QeU Griffin’s performance created a buzz among scouts and coaches - and also caught the attention of NFL players. “Shaquem Griffin killing it,” tweeted three-time NFL defensive player of the year JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans. Four-time Pro Bowler Richard Sherman wrote: “If @Shaquemgriffin doesn’t get drafted in the first two days the system is broken. Productive and performed well at the combine. Played well against high level competition.” Shaquem Griffin killing it. If @Shaquemgriffin doesn’t get drafted in the first two days the system is broken. Productive and performed well at the combine. Played well against high level competition. .@Seahawks HC @PeteCarroll reacts to @Shaquemgriffin's 40-yard dash. 😳#NFLCombine pic.twitter.com/UCwOLssDEH Griffin’s performance should be met with some caveats. Although the drills at the combine show coaches what players are capable of they are not predictors of success in the professional game. Many NFL stars have performed modestly at the event. Other players have displayed blazing speed only to struggle in the pros. However, Griffin did himself no harm in Indianapolis this week and is expected to be picked up by a team in the later rounds of the draft.
