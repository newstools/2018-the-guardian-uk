I’m in my 50s and very dependent on my younger gay partner (he is in his 30s). We have been together for 10 years and he is my first partner. Years ago, he had an affair. He said it had ended, but I think he has been cheating with the same guy for years. I don’t have many friends and don’t want to be alone as I age. We’re about to go on a six-month trip. Might this be a chance to heal things, or should we work towards separation? Is it satisfactory to continue, accepting that, as a younger man, his sexual needs aren’t met by me? I’m fond of him and he of me and he comments about us always being together, but sometimes I think I have replaced his mother, to whom he was very close. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
