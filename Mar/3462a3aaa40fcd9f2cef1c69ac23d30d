A city council member and her driver have been shot dead by two attackers on a downtown street in Rio de Janeiro in what appeared to be a targeted assassination. Richard Nunes, Rio’s head of public security, said there would be a “full investigation” into the killing of council member Marielle Franco and her driver, which came despite the military taking charge of policing the city last month after a surge in violence. Two police officials told Associated Press that two men in a car fired nine shots into the vehicle carrying the popular 38-year-old councillor and her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes. A press officer in the back seat was injured, but survived, the officials said. Both officials said it appeared Franco was targeted. Franco was a black woman who defied the odds of Rio politics to win the fifth highest vote count among council members when she was elected in 2016. She was an expert on police violence and on Saturday accused officers of being overly aggressive in searching residents of gang-controlled shantytowns. A member of a leftist party, Franco was also known for her social work in slums. She was in her first term in office. Her party called for a march on Friday to protest against violence in Rio. One of Franco’s last posts on Twitter called attention to police violence. “Another homicide of a young man that could be credited to the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church when he was killed. How many others will have to die for this war to end?” she wrote. Brazil’s public security minister, Raul Jungmann, said federal police would help investigate her killing. On 16 February, Brazil’s federal government put the military in charge of Rio’s local police amid a spike in violence. So far there are no indications of improvement in security in the city.
