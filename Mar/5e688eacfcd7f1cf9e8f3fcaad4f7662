Flight of the Conchords have postponed their upcoming UK and Ireland shows after member Bret McKenzie injured his hand. McKenzie said on Twitter that the musical comedy group had to delay their tour after he broke two bones falling down the stairs. He tweeted: “Unfortunately I’ve broken two bones in my hand today in a very rock ‘n’ roll injury – falling down some stairs. “The doctors have informed me that I won’t be able to perform for several weeks. I’m sorry not to be able to do these upcoming shows but I’m looking forward to coming back and finishing the tour when I have two fully functioning hands.” The duo – McKenzie and Jemaine Clement – also posted a statement on their website. It said: “Due to a hand injury that Bret McKenzie has suffered, Metropolis Music, Live Nation Entertainment, Chambers Touring and Flight of the Conchords regrettably announce the postponement and imminent rescheduling of the Flight of the Conchords Sing Flight of the Conchords tour. “Bret and Jemaine are extremely sorry and deeply saddened that they cannot perform for their UK fans, who have waited so patiently.”
