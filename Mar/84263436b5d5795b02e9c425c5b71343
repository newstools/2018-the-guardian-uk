Mauricio Pochettino has suggested that Harry Kane has an outside chance of making the Tottenham squad for Sunday’s Premier League derby at Chelsea. The striker damaged lateral ligaments in his right ankle at Bournemouth on 11 March and the original expectation was that he would be out until mid-April. But Kane is ahead of schedule in his recovery and, although it is more likely that he will feature on Saturday week at Stoke City, Pochettino did not rule him out of the visit to Stamford Bridge – where Tottenham will attempt to win for the first time since 1990. “We need to assess him in the next few days,” Pochettino said. “It’s difficult now to say yes or no. I cannot say no, but I cannot say yes. Maybe next weekend [he will return]. But the most important is that we are so positive about his recovery. We are doing fantastic and we are so happy. “After Bournemouth, everybody believed it would be a long period out but the resolution has been fantastic. He is very positive and he is doing very well. Every day he is improving.”
