This is one of our family staples. An ordinary dinner becomes a feast; a large platter oozing with polenta and sauce, topped by a pile of sausages. Italian sausages can be found in most Italian delis and some butcher’s shops. They work well roasted and grilled, but slowly, so they relax and soften. (Serves 5)4 red onions, cut into wedges4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced½ bottle red wine125ml olive oil400g tin chopped tomatoes2 bulbs of fennel, cut into wedges10 Italian pork and fennel sausagesSea salt and freshly ground pepperA bundle of fresh herbs, tied together eg thyme, parsley, rosemary and bay leaf Heat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Heat half the olive oil in a frying pan and gently cook the onions and garlic for five minutes. Add the fennel and cook for a further five minutes or so. In a separate pan, brown the sausages in the remaining olive oil for about 10 minutes on a medium heat, turning them often until they have a good all-over colour. Add the red wine and the tinned tomatoes, and bubble away for a few minutes. Arrange the fennel mixture in an ovenproof baking dish (about 32cm diameter, 5cm deep) and add the sausages with their tomato sauce. Season with a little salt and pepper, and add the bundle of herbs. Cook in the oven for 10 minutes. The sauce should be rich and the sausages richly browned. Serve on soft polenta, with rocket salad. Margot Henderson is chef and co-owner of Rochelle Canteen
