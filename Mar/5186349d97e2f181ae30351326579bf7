Former NFL offensive lineman Jonathan Martin is facing four charges of making criminal threats and one count of carrying a loaded firearm in the aftermath of his threatening Instagram post last month. Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said a warrant has been issued for Martin’s arrest and that police have been in contact with the 28-year-old’s attorney. Martin was detained by police on 23 February after his post on social media forced his former high school to shut down for the day. A pair of Harvard-Westlake High School campuses in LA were closed as a result of the post. The threat posted to Martin’s Instagram account read, “When you’re a bully victim & a coward, your options are suicide, or revenge.” Jonathan Martin with some seriously disturbing stuff here... pic.twitter.com/mbFf4jGPQG The post also included an image of a shotgun and shells, with four social media accounts tagged and hashtags for Harvard-Westlake and the Miami Dolphins. Among the four names tagged were former Dolphins team-mates Richie Incognito and Mike Pouncey. Incognito and Pouncey were accused by Martin of bullying following incidents in 2013. Incognito was suspended by the team for three months after Martin left the Dolphins midway through the 2013 season. Harvard-Westlake School has since filed a workplace violence prevention restraining order against Martin, according to ESPN. Multiple reports have said Martin checked into a mental health facility the same day he was detained. Martin attended Harvard-Westlake before going on to Stanford. He hasn’t played in the NFL since 2015.
