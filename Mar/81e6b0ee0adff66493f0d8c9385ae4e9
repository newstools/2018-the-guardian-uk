Barack Obama is in talks with Netflix about producing a series of high-profile shows, it has been reported. The former US president and his wife, Michelle, are in advanced negotiations with the streaming service, which has nearly 118 million subscribers, sources told the New York Times. The number of episodes and format of the shows has yet to be decided and Obama does not intend to use the programmes to directly respond to criticism by his successor, Donald Trump, or other political opponents. In addition to Netflix, executives from Apple and Amazon have expressed interest in talking to Obama about content deals, according to reports. The Netflix deal would give Obama an unfiltered means of communication with the public, although it is unclear how much he would be paid. Netflix recently signed a five-year, $300m (£215) deal to lure Ryan Murphy away from 21st Century Fox. Obama’s senior adviser, Eric Schultz, told the New York Times: “President and Mrs Obama have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire. Throughout their lives, they have lifted up stories of people whose efforts to make a difference are quietly changing the world for the better. “As they consider their future personal plans, they continue to explore new ways to help others tell and share their stories.” The paper said one possible idea would include Obama moderating conversations on topics that dominated his presidency, including healthcare and climate change. Another programme could feature the former first lady discussing topics such as nutrition, which she championed in the White House. Obama appeared in the debut episode of David Letterman’s Netflix series, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, which began in January.
