Actor Tiffany Haddish’s claim that she once witnessed another actor biting Beyoncé on the face has sparked a social media hunt for the alleged culprit. Haddish told GQ she once met Beyoncé at a party in Los Angeles in December last year. The party was also attended by the singer’s musician husband, Jay-Z. According to Haddish, the actor, whom she refused to name, was at the party “doing the mostest” before biting Beyoncé in the face. In an earlier version of the story, Haddish suggested that the actor was flirting with Jay-Z at the time, before Beyoncé intervened. Haddish said that she later approached the pop-star about the incident. “So I said to Beyoncé, ‘Did she really bite you?’ She was like, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘She gonna get her ass beat tonight.’ She was like, ‘Tiffany, no. Don’t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill,’” Haddish said. When asked for comment, a representative for Beyoncé told GQ: “I absolutely cannot comment on any of this, as I have no knowledge.” The episode, referred to as bite-gate, has sent internet sleuths into a frenzy, tweeting #WhoBitBeyonce and attempting to identify the culprit. This is not a case for the police. #WhoBitBeyonce pic.twitter.com/t5COPMWhWh Becky With The Good Veneers #WhoBitBeyonce pic.twitter.com/aYcTWef4gb IF YOU HAVE A NAME AND YOU AREN’T SPILLING YOU ARE HARBORING A FUGITIVE! #WhoBitBeyonce pic.twitter.com/j2nt01a0sH The most popular theories concerned actors such as Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lena Dunham and Jennifer Lawrence (none of the actors in question have commented publicly on the allegations).

Foster, who starred in the TV series 90210, responded to the allegations in an Instagram post, stating, “I wish I could get close enough to Beyoncé to bite her”. Flattering that anyone thinks I could get this close to Beyoncé. A post shared by  Sara Foster (@sarafoster) on Mar 26, 2018 at 11:47am PDT Sanaa Lathan declared on Twitter that the only biting she would do to Beyoncé would be in the form of a love bite. Y’all are funny. Under no circumstances did I bite Beyonce and if I did it would’ve been a love bite 💋 The TV presenter Chrissy Teigen also weighed in, tweeting: “I can only think of one person who would do this. But I cannot say. But she … is the worst”. I can only think of one person who would do this. but I cannot say. but she....is the worst. The speculation continues.
