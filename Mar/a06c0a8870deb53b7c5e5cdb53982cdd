There’s something liberating about the simplicity of a friand. To take a bite of one is to be reminded of the very reason we love cake. Key to its beauty is the browned butter. Take care when doing this, however: perfect brown is achieved only a few seconds short of unappetising, charred black. If you are worried it might burn, pour the butter into a heatproof dish right away. These are relatively large friands, so use a deeper, 12-hole muffin tray rather than a cupcake tray. Prep 12 minCook 15 minMakes 12 185g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing50g plain flour200g golden icing sugar150g ground almonds2½ tsp ground ginger2 tbsp lemon juiceZest of 1 lemon, finely grated5 large egg whites (about 225g)3 balls of stem ginger, finely diced Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Melt a couple of teaspoons of butter and use it to grease generously the insides of a 12-hole muffin tray. Melt the remaining 185g butter in a small saucepan, then cook for a few minutes, until the water boils off and it starts to bubble up into a buttery foam. Swirl the pan, until the butter takes on the brown of hazelnut shells, then set aside. While the butter is browning, sieve together the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds and ground ginger. Pour in the browned butter, the lemon juice and zest, and stir to combine. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then stir about a third into the friand mix to loosen it up. Carefully fold in another third, until just combined, followed by the final third. Fold in the stem ginger, reserving a little to sprinkle over the tops of the friands. Divide the mix equally between the 12 muffin holes and top with a final sprinkling of stem ginger. Bake for 15 minutes until golden and springy. Cool on a wire rack and serve warm.
