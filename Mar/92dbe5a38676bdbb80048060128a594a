The inquest into the death of the Russian exile Nikolai Glushkov has opened and been adjourned in London. Richard Furniss, the assistant coroner at west London coroner’s court, heard evidence on Thursday that Glushkov’s body was found at home on 12 March before paramedics called police at 10.46pm. Two minutes later, the paramedics declared Glushkov dead. Terry Waple, the coroner’s court officer, said paramedics stated “life extinct” and confirmed that a postmortem has concluded the 68-year-old died of “compression to the neck”. Furniss said the proceedings would determine who the deceased was, when and where they died, their medical cause of death and the circumstances surrounding it. He adjourned the inquest pending further police investigation.
