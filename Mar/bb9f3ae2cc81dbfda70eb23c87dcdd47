Lewis Hamilton said he would prefer to trust his racer’s instinct rather than instruction from his Mercedes team after they admitted that it was likely a software error cost him victory at the opening grand prix of the season in Australia. Hamilton was passed by Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel when the German took advantage of pitting under the virtual safety car. Mercedes had not advised Hamilton to open up a greater lead since their data was telling them the gap he held was sufficient. But that information proved incorrect. “Definitely,” was Hamilton’s reply when asked if he would prefer to use his intuition over computer analysis. “Today it is such a team effort but when you are relying on so much data, so much technology to come out with the strategy or whatever, I wish it was more in my hands. I feel like I was driving as good as ever today.” The four-time world champion was adamant that, had he known a greater advantage was needed to ensure Vettel could not pass him during a stop under the VSC, he could have achieved it. “In the race I had extra tools,” he said. “I could have been further ahead by the first pitstop. There were so many things we could have done. But if you think you are doing it by the book and the limits then there is nothing you can do.” Hamilton pushed hard to catch Vettel in the second half of the race but with passing exceptionally hard at Albert Park he could do little and ultimately chose to accept second to conserve his engine. The teams are allowed to use only three before incurring grid penalties and Hamilton criticised the restraints this placed on the drivers. “That goes against my spirt of racing,” he said. “I want to race right down to the line. I am fit enough, I felt good. But the way the sport is set up with three engines you have to think about that and back off. So its probably not exciting for the fans.”
