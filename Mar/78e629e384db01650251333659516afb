The Borussia Dortmund striker Michy Batshuayi, who is on loan from Chelsea, has been inundated with racially abusive messages on social media, allegedly sent by Atalanta fans. The Belgian, who claimed last month that he was the victim of monkey chants during Dortmund’s Europa League match at Atalanta, has shared a host of messages, many containing monkey and banana emojis. They were apparently sent in the wake of the German club’s exit from the competition at the hands of Salzburg on Thursday night. Uefa has already opened disciplinary proceedings against Atalanta following the alleged racist behaviour by their supporters in the game against Dortmund, which ended in a 1-1 draw to send the Germans through. Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body will deal with the case on 22 March. Batshuayi said on Twitter after the Atalanta game: “2018 and still racists monkey noises in the stands ... really ?! Hope you have fun watching the rest of @EuropaLeague on TV while we are through #SayNoToRacism #GoWatchBlackPanther.”
