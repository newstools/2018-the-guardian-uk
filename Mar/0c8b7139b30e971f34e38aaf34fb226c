Security video shows a Florida sheriff’s deputy go toward the high school building while a gunman massacred 17 students and staff members, but he stayed outside with his handgun drawn. The Broward county sheriff’s office released the video on Thursday showing Deputy Scot Peterson’s actions during the 14 February shooting. It shows him and a staff member rushing toward the building in a cart. He pulls his weapon and takes up a position outside the building. During much of the shooting, the camera’s view of Peterson is blocked by a light pole but parts of him occasionally appear. Sheriff Scott Israel blasted Peterson eight days after the shooting, saying Peterson should have “went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer”. The 54-year-old deputy retired rather than accept a suspension. He is still being investigated by internal affairs. A Florida judge earlier this week agreed with news outlets including the Associated Press that the video should be released. Police and school officials had resisted the release, saying it was evidence in an active investigation. Students across the country walked out of school amid the national gun control debate on Wednesday.
