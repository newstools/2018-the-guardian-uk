For the past two years, I’ve been paid for sex. I was an intern barely surviving on minimum wage when another intern suggested I check out a website where you set up “arrangements” with wealthy men. The first few dates were nerve-racking but exciting – I have a high sex drive and am attracted to older men – and once I got comfortable with asking for a figure up front, it started to come naturally. As an escort, I frequently earn 10 times more than the day rate in my normal job. The nature of the website I use means that what I do sits between straight-up escorting and regular dating; I rarely just have sex with these men. They’ll take me to dinner and we’ll talk about our lives, or we’ll see a film or do karaoke, before having sex. My accountant lists my job as alternative therapy, and that is pretty accurate. So often what these men really need and want is someone to listen to them; the sex is just a vehicle to get to that. While the financial goal keeps me doing this, I worry about the effect on my emotional health. I planned to quit if I met someone I wanted to commit to, but the more I earn, the harder it is to do that. I haven’t even come close so far and that can’t be a coincidence. I regularly have sex with guys who aren’t paying, but when I’m with them, I’ll often think, “I could be making £400 right now.” Separating work and play is hard. It’s also physically exhausting as I rarely give myself a night off. I worry I’m starting to forget what genuine intimacy feels like, since I’m so good at simulating it, but feeling nothing. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
