I’ve always enjoyed sex and been comfortable with my body, but several years of unhappy marriage robbed me of a lot of confidence. I got divorced three years ago, aged 38, and thought it would be a tall order to find someone right for me; a real physical click felt crucial but rare. I’ve been seeing my current partner for two years and he welcomes my expression, both verbal and physical, of my desire for him. The first time we had sex was at his place of work. We had known each other for a long time, and had both fantasised about this, so when he finally laid me down on the floor there, it felt so right. It was clear from the beginning that our sexual contact need not be limited to the bedroom. One of the first times we had sex outside was on a small Caribbean island. We had gone for a morning hike up the headland to watch the sunrise; the shore was deserted and we made love standing up on the rocks. Although I knew there was a small risk we might be seen, I felt totally comfortable. Since then, we have had sex on beaches, in a park, behind our rented motorbike, on a picnic table, and on a balcony overlooking a boulevard in the half-light of evening. Luckily, we have just as much fun between the sheets – European winters are less conducive to outdoor lovemaking – but we are both looking forward to the summer. I feel grateful every day for the love and sexual connection we have found. It’s as if we have stumbled on treasure. Who would have thought that, after a long period of sadness and rejection, such fulfilment, liberation and sheer joy would await? • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.
