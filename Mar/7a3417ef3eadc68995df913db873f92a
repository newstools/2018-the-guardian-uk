Eight men have been charged with theft, burglary and trespassing offences after two supermarkets were looted in Dublin during Friday’s blizzards. The defendants, aged between 24 and 47, were due to appear in court on Saturday. A number of vehicles were also reported stolen. A ninth man, in his 30s, has been arrested for handling stolen property. Unverified social media footage appeared to show a Lidl store being smashed with a digger before the alleged looters entered. Irish police said the store, on Fortunestown Lane in the west of the city, had sustained substantial damage, while another store had also been damaged. The alleged incident came amid some of the worst snowstorms to hit Ireland for decades. As well as the looting of the two supermarkets, the shells of several burnt-out cars were found abandoned in the snow following a night of vandalism. Irish police said: “Following reports of burglary and theft of vehicles, Garda units deployed in the Tallaght district and nine arrests were made to date. “Substantial damage was caused to a supermarket on Fortunestown Lane and further damage to another premises in Jobstown. All those arrested are currently detained at Dublin Garda stations.” Police urged anyone with information to come forward. Colm Brophy, a member of Ireland’s ruling Fine Gael party, said: “I am particularly mindful that these actions have taken place in the midst of a code red weather warning when our emergency services are at full stretch.”
