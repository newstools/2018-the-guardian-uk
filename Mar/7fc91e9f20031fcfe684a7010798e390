The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘cosy .’ Share your photos of what cosy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box. The closing date is Wednesday 7 March at 10am. We’ll publish our favourites in The New Review on Sunday 11 March and in a gallery on the Guardian site. You can share your ‘cosy ’ pictures by clicking on the ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the Guardian app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’ – and if you add it to the homepage – you can keep up with all our assignments.
