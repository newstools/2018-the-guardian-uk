There were hoots of laughter from guests at a recent wedding when an owl that was supposed to be delivering the rings, instead attacked one of the best men. All seemed well when the bird of prey flew down the aisle and landed on the arm of the first best man. But, after a brief pause, the owl turned on the second best man, knocking him off his seat, drawing gasps and laughter from the wide-eyed guests. “The best man’s reaction, when he fell off the seat and the crowd erupting into laughing was just great. For some reason, the owl just decided he wanted to go for him and he was just terrified. He’s absolutely petrified of anything that flies,” said the wedding photographer, Stacey Oliver.

After accosting the best men, the owl perched on the table used for signing the wedding register and glowered at the congregation. The bride said the incident was “absolutely hilarious”, adding: “It was an amazing day for us both, and has given us great memories we will never forget.” Oliver said: “It was one of the best moments I’ve ever seen. One of my friends had an owl ring-bearer at her wedding and it all went to plan, it flew in, dropped them off and went back so when this happened it was just so funny. “Then there was a panic when the owl flew off and we didn’t know where he was but it was fine, we found him.” It is not the first time an owl has caused trouble on a couple’s big day. In 2015, a bird reportedly took fright and tried to fly out through a closed window – smashing headfirst into it. In 2013, the BBC reported that a service was delayed when an owl bearing the rings fell asleep in the church roof.
